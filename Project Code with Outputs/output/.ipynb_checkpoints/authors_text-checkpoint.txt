"227885488:::677728541:::Amber Lee Cooper:::My father was a touring musician, and I was on tour with him before I was even born, my mother had to come home from his tour to have me, and I'm sure that's where the music-making gypsy in me came from.

Music has called to me many times in life, and no matter how far away I got from music, and from myself, somehow I always ended back up with music, as a big part of my personal life.
For many reasons, I didn't feel ready for music's call, but, two years ago my dad asked me to be part of his band “Guilty Pleasures”. Working with them was amazing. They have so many years of experience in creating and performing music and they gave me the chance to find my voice. Performing with them gave me a platform to bring all my past musical experiences into one expression, and I can’t thank them enough for that. I found a very alive, artistic part of myself through that process, as well as the urge to create my own music.

I have since picked up an instrument, written a handful of original songs, and posted videos on my social media sites. Watching how a song can make such an impact on those around me, inspired me to make this EP!

Being a single mom, I also felt the best way for me to show my kids how to follow their dreams, was to follow my own.
So here I am, taking the leap, hoping you'll join me on this first flight!:::1338:::270:::0.28036075036075037:::0.5610894660894661:::1:::2:::2018|||"

That means we make functional tools, that look great, and are all designed from different perspectives, which means we don’t stick a bottle opener and multi wrench on everything. We run a 5th generation homestead in Texas, We get dirty, sweat, swear, and like our tools, we get the job done.

Grim Workshop is an American brand who’s products are carried by soldiers, Hunters, Tradesmen, and many, many more. Our mission is to create tools as unique as the people who carry them, and like those people, our tools are always changing. We spare no expense, and make no compromises when it comes to our tools, and their quality. We don’t mass produce our products, we manufacture each tool in small batch runs, that allow us to constantly evolve, and adapt our tools to our users needs. All of our tools are designed, engineered, and many produced in Texas, but everything is made in the U.S.A, and every piece of gear with our name on it, has our warranty on it as well.

Our tools were designed under three principals

be reusable - Grim’s custom fabricated Tool Retention System allows you to return any removable parts to their original position


be compact - Grim’s tools are all designed to be stored perfectly flat, and come in at just 1mm thick on average.

be functional - we use the highest quality 400 series stainless steel, hardened for extra durability, and as diverse in design as our customers.

Each Grim Tool is created to be carried by anyone, at anytime, without any extra considerations needed. a credit card tool in a parents wallet, one of our dog tag tools on a soldiers neck, a micro tool on a students keychain, each tool we make is specially designed to be wearable, compact, reusable, and lightweight, but most of all, functional. What you need, Where you need it. (which is with you)

Whether our products are used to save space, save time, or save a life, Grim’s got a tool for that.

"389440451:::556515918:::Belos Watches:::The company
Magnus Dovenstam and Andreas Johansson founded Belos Watches from the idea of a self-winding automatic watch for every moment, every wallet, every season and for everyone. Everyone deserves looking great keeping track of the time!

It all started back in 2011 when Magnus Dovenstam and Andreas Johansson went to Utö, an amazing island just outside Stockholm. Magnus showed Andreas his new watch. Clean white dial, case of rose gold, brown leather strap and battery-driven quartz movement. The big thing missing was the smooth sliding second hand only able with an automatic clockwork. Right there, the brainstorming began and the poorly done napkin sketches finally, 5 years later, resulted in the first Belos collection Utö.

When Utö reached the market, the work of Huvudskär began where the founders wanted to create a Swedish diver with influences from the diving wreck Fylgia, located just outside of Huvudskär at 58°57.83N 18°33.90E. After months of sketching, designing and prototyping every single part of the watch, the second Belos collection is finally here!

The name Belos
Belos is an old venerable naval ship name in the Swedish army. Even today in our modern society, we have a naval ship named HMS Belos. HMS Belos is Swedens largest naval ship at the moment.

Belos is also nautical associated in Greek mythology where Belos was king of Egypt and the illegitimate son of Poseidon, god of the sea.:::1435:::233:::0.1598912198912199:::0.2999192474192474:::1:::0:::2017|||"

Thanks so much for showing an interest in my project, Yona. My name is Joshua K, and I am a singer-songwriter. I have had it in my heart for a very long time to start a musical project that would allow my music to come to life and that would reach your ears and maybe your hearts. I guess then it has been some kind of dream, or rather, a need to start this band and to satisfy the truth that is within me to write, record & perform songs.

2018 was a year of personal shifts, letting go and moving forward, a culmination of years of personal development and spiritual growth which has finally seen my music come into some materialisation. I have spent many hours of my free time this year, demoing the many songs I have had over the years, improving my singing ability, and breaking through the shackles or fear and performing at shows.

I've been working for many years on this project already and although this seems like just the beginning, the roots are firmly in the soil and the shoots have been sprouting. This first record will mark the public beginning of Yona, and I can't wait to share the journey with you.:::1142:::212:::0.18343749999999998:::0.398125:::1:::0:::2018|||"
"1919815172:::1715370322:::Sonny Tapper:::I am just some Swedish guy with lots of emotions and thoughts that I want to express. In this page you can read about me and what led me to this moment in life.

So let me begin:



I was born and raised in Sweden but from a few different parts of this long country. I started my life in Malung, Dalarna which is a small town famous for its crazy ""dansbandsvecka"" (swedish dance music for old people and cool people) and leather. My parents separated and I ended up in some concrete houses in the city of Uppsala. Where I began my life as an aware being.

I went to school and life was kind of normal, nothing really crazy was actually happening these years, or well I was eating grass at one point together with a friend of mine. During my late teenage years I got into some bad habits and I watched myself from the sideline while my life was slowly falling into pieces. Then something happened. I was arrested by the police and well we do not need to go into any details but from that moment on my life became somewhat tricky. But you know nowadays I could not be more happy about what happened. It really takes being at the bottom and finding your way to appreciate the road towards the top. From that moment on I promised myself that I would never have to depend on anyone or anything but myself. This experience rebuilt me and made me into to the interesting character that I am today. There is no point in building a skyscraper from top to bottom. The foundation needs to be stable to hold the future.

For many different reasons I ended up in Israel working as a volunteer at a kibbutz named Baram. It was in the northern parts of the country about 300 meters from the Lebanese border. I was going to stay for 3 months but ended up staying for 6. Being outside of your own country for that long really puts things in perspective. I started meeting people I could not imagine meeting and until today I am sure I could go travel around the world and have someone to call almost no matter what country. People is important. People will set you on a path and everyone you meet, it does not matter good or bad, along the way is a teacher. Thank you Sumi Kim for being such a big part of my life at that time. Traveling changed my fundamental ideas for the rest of my life. I wanted from this moment on become a person of interest. A person that people will remember as leaving them with a lesson. A person that does good things for himself and others. This quest it is a never ending story though and I am still young.

From there I went to live in the UK working with Sam and Ben (who I became good friends with during my time in Israel) sorting potatoes during harvest. It was not a very challenging job but it was really a crazy time. It is the people and the memories that make this part a very good time in my life. I felt life like I was standing on top of a mountain but still surrounded with many more mountains around me to climb.

So that is a small piece of the background of myself but how did I end up a chef working in some of the worlds top restaurants? Well that is actually something I ask myself a lot. What happened? haha It feels like it was all a dream.

My plan was going to Australia to meet up with Sam. First I had to get some money. So I went back to Sweden working some mindless jobs and with my first paycheck I booked the ticket via South Korea so I could visit Sumi on the way. I worked another month, packed my bags and left. I was intoxicated by life and travel.

I arrived in Korea and I knew I was not in Sweden anymore. It was a crazy realization and I felt like everyone was looking at me like I was famous. I was surprised by many things and also in Korea was the first time I fell in love with food.

The flavours was just something else and everything was of such high standard I was really impressed and I still until this day remember Sumis mothers bulgogi and kimchi which was like the most amazing thing ever. I stayed in Korea for one month this time but I was sure I would come back. And which I did another three times.

Anyways, I eventually landed in Sydney filled with a mix of excitement and loneliness. I had about 5000 SEK in my bank account and the plan was to stay for a year. You know it was really a crazy thing to do seeing I had only one friend in a country of 24 million people but I figured I could do anything. And I did.

After 10 days I decided to spend my last money on a bus ticket to Melbourne. I came there to meet my friend and hopefully he could help me out. And I was right. I found work and I was doing hard labor jobs like digging dirt and carrying heavy object from one place to another. I started earning some money and everything was looking sweet. After a while I was offered a full time job as a dishwasher in this shady locals pub. I took the job and I knew from the first day that I was gonna make something of myself within hospitality. I got my chance to step in to the kitchen when this German guy who was working there kind of got deported. Or he overstayed his visa without knowing it and then he was not allowed back in the country after his holiday. The opportunity was in front of me and I grabbed it to never let go.



I had to return to Sweden after being 18 months in Australia. I decided to start studying to become a chef and then take it from there. I applied to a school in Stockholm and was accepted. I learnt a lot and I made some really good contacts during that time. For example it was my teacher who recommended me to go work in the UK at Northcote Manor which is a Michelin starred establishment and has been so for 20 years.



Working life in the UK is way different to the way we work in Sweden. There is a lot of abuse and name calling. There is a lot of bullying and very little positivity. The one good thing about working in the UK is the obession of standards. And the obsession of making sure every little detail is in its absolute correct form. That is the one thing I really took with me from Northcote. Standards. Northcote is located in a very remote area about one hour north of Manchester and there is literally nothing to do. So me and my wife (yea I got married during this time) Juliana decided to move to London.



We packed our stuff and took the bus. We arrived there without any idea on what to do. I started looking for a job and sent some applications and I managed somehow to get in touch with Michael Jonsson who was head chef and owner of Hedone in Chiswick, west London.

Working at Hedone was a career changing experience. I never ever seen such fantastic produce. For those who does not know his philosophy was that it is not possible to make great food without great produce. And that is without any doubt the most important lesson I learnt during my time there. I spent almost one year at Hedone working 80+ hours per week. It is a tough environment but it hardens you. And its well worth to challenge yourself in this way. Of course when you are in it its like a never ending story of work work work. But the reward is great. I walked out of there a different person. Confidence in my own abilities and confidence in myself.



After spending so much time in the kitchen I was really looking for something where I could work less and spend more time together with my wife. So I found this agency where I could have a lot more saying in when I wanted and where I wanted to work. The salary was also very good. Our idea was to save as much money as possible so that we could take a six months holiday to Brasil before proceeding to go back to life in Sweden. The jobs were ranging from local gastropubs to 5 star hotels and luxurious private members clubs.



Me and Juliana packed our bags and left London behind. We arrived in Sao Paulo in October so just in time for summer. Life was beautiful. Juliana had made a detailed plan for our travels which was just fantastic. We started of traveling to some places just outside of Sao Paulo. During that time I was in contact with restaurant D.O.M which is awarded 2 michelin stars and also voted number 3 best restaurant in the world according to S. Pellegrino 50th best list. We were discussing the possibility of me going there for one months time to learn about them and what they were doing.

After about one month staying in Sao paulo we started our travels.

It took us from Sao paulo to the very north of Brasil. Going from one amazing place to another, mountains, waterfalls, beaches and lush rainforests, finishing the trip with a 7 day boat ride on the Amazon river. We were on the road for about 4 months and spent most of our nights in a tent. And this part is one of the best times of my life. The feeling of being free and in contact with nature and the most beautiful places I have ever seen. I really grew from this experience. Learning a lot about life and what life actually is about. Swimming in the waterfalls with the energy from the water that cleans your soul is such an amazing experience I wish that everyone could have. Happiness in its most raw format.

We came back to Sao Paulo for one last month and I started my work experience at D.O.M.

And let me just say one thing. Almost no one could speak English and my portuguese at the time was not really the best so there was a lot of very funny moments with a lot of laughters. For example I remember the time I drank a cup of steel polish thinking it was water.

The experience at D.O.M was really amazing. They have such a great team there and the atmosphere in the restaurant is really phenomenal. I do not know if you know about Alex Atala who is the chef and owner of D.O.M but he is a really down to earth kind of guy and he is doing some really good things for a lot people. He is an inspiration for many individuals in the industry and for me as well.

Well time to get back to reality. The plane landed in Stockholm and the Brazilian dream was over. 6 months and a lot of incredible experiences later we arrived in Sweden just in time for summer. It was May 2016.

I needed to get a job. I was out of a job for 6 months and it was not like we had won the lottery so the bank account was not a very pleasant thing to look at in that moment.

I contacted Sören Polonoius who at that time was the head sommelier at Esperanto restraurant and who I met and talked to during his meal at Hedone. He managed to get me in touch with Sayan Isaksson chef and owner of Esperanto. I went there for a trial and they liked me and I liked them.

Working with Sayan Isaksson at Esperanto was like another type of cooking, another world. I never seen such aesthetic details in food before. I would say he is an artist, a creative genius in the highest level and also he makes the best stocks and sauces I have ever tasted. My job at Esperanto consisted of running the hot section most of the time and I really saw that as a great challenge. To be responsible of the hot kitchen working at that level of prestige is something I am really proud of until today. During my time at Esperanto I also met Saori Ichihara.

Saori and I became good friends and we were hanging out talking a lot about ideas for things and we shared a lot of similiar thought and ideas about food and people. Even though we are completely different from each other and come from completely different backgrounds we somehow connected. A few months after I finished my job in Esperanto Saori was offered to open a restaurant of her own together with the Kvarnefalt brothers.

An idea was born and the work begun to open up restaurant Ichi. I was at that time working at Tyge och Sessil which is the winebar in Stockholm owned by Niklas Ekstedt. So my part in Ichi came a little bit later on.

The restaurant opened in October 2017. Working at Ichi is without a doubt the best work experience I have ever had. I mean being part of something new and being able to say what I think really made me grew as a person. And as I was sous chef there I had quite a lot of responsibility which evolved my thoughts about why and how and not just do. Ichi is very important for me because of all the things I learnt and not just about cooking food. But about myself and about running a successful business.

But all good things come to an end. I recently left Ichi to pursue my dreams of doing something for myself.

After years and years of hard and precise work I am really excited to start the process of understanding myself and my own food. That is why I am now working on this project.:::12574:::2408:::0.18400823223256996:::0.35312569957023593:::1:::0:::2018|||"

"2120511207:::927096151:::Karina Nistal:::Singer/songwriter Karina Nistal is known to align herself with diverse and solid collaborations to showcase her extensive range. Her work consists of emotive jazz vocals on downtempo tracks, rapping in Spanish for the worldly sounds of reggaeton, or fusing soulful Latin vocals with lively dance music. Most significantly, it is a vibrant charisma that carries over her poetic musings in either English or Spanish, or her self-assured flirtatious rhymes. There's a very fine line between poetry and rap, but it's one that only Karina interconnects with finesse. Music captivated the native Houstonian at an early age. Karina indulged in old school hip hop, rhythm & blues, soul and jazz. It was Karina's mixed Latin heritage (Mexican and Cuban) that spotlighted traditional to modern styles. After several years of featuring on numerous Dance and Hip Hop releases, Karina made her first full-length bilingual debut album, Nistyle (Starlightbeats) which introduced the term ""Reggaetron"" (Electro-Reggaeton). Nistyle gives a fresh face to the growing ""hurban"" dance scene and earned Karina various accomplishments including an Armed Forces tour in the Middle East to provide support and morale for our troops. The following year, the video for her single “Viviendo” premiered internationally on MUN² bilingual video network. Meanwhile, The Karina Nistal Band performed festivals all over the southern region including the SXSW Music Festival and made a local television appearance on the Mayor’s Tree-lighting Celebration - KHOU Houston. Karina is also a Houston Press Award winner for “Local Hip Hop” & “Latin Contemporary”. Her sophomore album, Nistalgia (L.O.V.E. Records) was released October 2010. Nistalgia carries her Latin Fusion sound with a mixture of Soul, Hip Hop and a few hot Dance remixes. After relocating to Los Angeles that spring, Karina began working on her project #KaRAGEous. She became an ambassador for the fastest growing inspirational network #Besomebody. Karina then turned to her fans in Fall 2013 to launch a successful Kickstarter campaign to fund her project released that winter. “KaRAGEous is a fun, sassy, and well-rounded [album] that plays everything from downtempo, drum & bass, to dubstep,” Karina describes this album. “You guys really need to check it out!” Karina continues performing with her band “The Live Project”, recording singles, making videos, collaborating with various artists, and recording commercial voice-overs. Her last single “Different” earned the “Best Pop/Electronica” category through the Akademia Music Awards while her recent collaboration with Sand B “Like In Paradise” continues to receive international reviews while playing on air in several countries worldwide. She has just finished shooting her next video “Heavy” which will give her fans something to look forward to in the Fall along with new album ""Living Proof"" coming soon! With seemingly a lot on her plate, the sultry, multi-faceted vocalist admits, ""I want to do so much more!"":::3004:::481:::0.1455261353553279:::0.31930574601382056:::3:::11:::2011|||"

I have little time for products (or services for that matter) that are anything but the best.

I'm no billionaire...

And because I'm not a billionaire yet - then I really can't afford the ""best"" of everything in all things. However, I still like to look after myself the best way I can!

When I was a kid...

I used to love dressing up, getting ready to go out, going to friends parties and was very focused on how I present myself to other people.

Both my grandfathers, had the very same mindset and as a young child taught me the importance of good presentation and always looking good and how this could ""help you later in life"". To me, back then I thought that doesn't make sense but now I am living an adult life submersed in the throngs of bustling London - I get it completely. Presentation and appearance is everything!

Genetics or not...

This combination of only accepting the best in life - together with the love of looking and feeling good - has ultimately led me to start thinking about ways I could combine the two together into an application that I believe is truly convenience based and satisfies the busy lifestyle of London's professional men and offers 'top notch' services that make its clients feel like they are getting the 'quality treatment'.

So... has this little ""bio"" given you some insight into who I am? I hope so.

Now it's up to YOU...

Help me to design and fund an application which will help to satisfy a need in many cities of having a mobile barber at your fingertips when you want them. Whether that be on a weekend when your home watching football on the sofa, after work before drinks with the boys or even at last minute when you score that date you've been waiting on and you just want to make sure you look fresh in an hours time!

If you're reading this - there's a good chance I currently have a Kickstarter Campaign running. If I do - then get yourself over to that page and help fund it.

If you've backed it - thank you! I promise, hand-on-heart, that you will love what you've backed. If you've not backed it - then you really need to decide whether you want the best in life.

Kickstarter is what allows someone to take the ""leap"" from late-night, kitchen-table, back-of-the-envelope type designing and building ...to reaching the ""next level"" and put my ideas in your hands (literally!).

I look forward to working with you.

"779600119:::1377280501:::Kathy Skinos-Smith:::First generation Greek-American. Born and raised in the Kansas City area by two wonderful parents, John & Georgia Skinos, and my sister Anastasia. Growing up we were part of a large and vibrant Greek community here in the area. My parents were hard-working people who loved this country and the opportunities it provided them.

In the early 1980's they decided to open their own restaurant, Georgia's Greek Cuisine. Over the 12 years they owned the restaurant, they became know for their outstanding food and service they provided to their customers. People still tell me how much they enjoyed my parents and the wonder taste of Greece they provided.

After helping parents parents launch their restaurant and graduating from Avila University in Kansas City, I embarked on a career in sales & marketing with a range of companies including Kellogg's. Pillsbury and Hallmark Cards. In the late 1990's, I was approached by the late Mr. Fred Ball, the owner and CEO of Balls Food Stores here in the Kansas City area. Balls Food Stores operate Sun Fresh, Price Chopper and their flagship Hen House Markets throughout the area. Mr. Ball had developed over the years a reputation for helping entrepreneurs launch their business. Mr. Ball offered me the use of his company commissary and placement in his stores, at no cost or fees, to facilitate the launch of Katina's Greek Cafe to produce a line of handmade frozen Greek appetizers and Baklava. The only thing he asked in return was that I be successful!

Over the years I've had the pleasure of selling my products through my website, to food retailers here in the Kansas City area, and national retailers such as Dean & Deluca and Williams-Sonoma.

I currently live in Leawood, Kansas, a suburb of Kansas City. I've been married to my husband Steve for the past 14 years; he's not Greek, so his life is something like ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"", only different!:::1916:::330:::0.22394692725575077:::0.46185807656395883:::2:::0:::2018|||"

"1491601918:::296366982:::Craig Alan Huber:::I began with photography around the age of 8 when my father first loaned me his Argus C-3 rangefinder camera. While all the other kids were making pictures using new color films from Kodak, I was out with black and white film discovering patterns and textures. Removing the dimension of color and working with shades of grey presents a unique challenge and offers new possibilities for me to this day.

For the last 18 years I have worked primarily with large format view cameras ranging from 4x5 to 11x14. A view camera offers the ultimate in composition flexibility, and obliges a methodical working process that resonates well with the images that I am compelled to make. Working in a traditional wet darkroom with wonderfully large negatives, I hand-craft prints in gelatin silver or platinum/palladium, depending on the 'look' best suiting each image.

I am honored to have my work in permanent collections including The Vatican Library, The Huntington Library, The UC Berkeley Bancroft Library, University of Washington Special Collections, the National Steinbeck Center, the Basilica of Saint Mary in Minneapolis, Mission San Antonio de Padua, and the Museo de Fray Junípero Serra in Majorca, Spain; and is collected by individuals throughout the US, Europe, and Australia. It has been my honor to have my work represented in solo Exhibitions at Gold Street Studios, Australia, The Basilica of Saint Mary, Trinity Parish in Seattle, and the Washington Cathedral; as well as in numerous group shows at venues including the Carmel Art Institute and RayKo Photo Center in San Francisco.

"624094541:::1402435081:::Scott Fox:::Hi everyone, my name is Scott Fox, and I am the illustrator/co-creator of Coloring the Bible. I have to say “co-creator” because honestly this idea was not all mine. After falling in love with art, specifically cartoon drawing, as a child, I imagined I would be a cartoonist when I grew up. But when my mother unexpectedly died, my desire for art changed. I walked away from my dreams, started hanging out with other broken kids, and walked out a life of destruction - mainly fueled by rage, alcohol, and drugs. But God had a different plan for me. He entered my life in a big way, and spoke to me - telling me my next steps and giving me the opportunity to cultivate a real relationship with Him. During the 8-months I spend in jail (turning myself in was one of the major directions He gave), I rediscovered my passion for both Jesus and drawing. My favorite thing to draw was, and still is, scripture. This is how Coloring the Bible started - as a verse-by-verse comic book. The first one I completed was the story of when Jesus calms the storm. Remember all the anger I talked about having? This story in the Bible, along with some other scriptures, helped me believe Jesus was in my angry storms, would calm the waters for me, and would someday teach me how to keep control of them myself. It was an extremely powerful time in my life. After my release, my fire for Jesus never went away - it actually has only gotten bigger year by year! As far as the drawing went, thanks be to God I never gave up on a dream I thought was impossible - even when my fear was telling me to. Throughout the years, we have slowly been working on these coloring books, while He has been working in me to slowly build my courage and confidence in both His ability and in mine. Now, here we are! Releasing to you a dream that I believe can change the world, starting with each child.:::1867:::347:::0.06304824561403509:::0.4926900584795321:::1:::0:::2018|||"

HIS ETHOS IS SIMPLY TO PUT HIS DREAMS AND VISONS ACROSS AND MAKE THESE A REALITY. HE IS ABLE TO DO THIS BY HARNESSING THE VERY BEST TEAM TOGETHER TO CREATE IMPRESSIVE, UNIQUE, STRONG AND VIABLE SOLUTIONS. HE IS CONFIDENT, PRAGMATIC, AMBITIOUS AND DISCIPLINED.

OLLIVER IS A TRUE LEADER AND CREATOR, who BRINGS THIS INCREDIBLE OPPORTUNITY TO Fruition and PRESENTS THIS PROJECT TO YOU WITH PASSION, HIS CREATIVE GENIUS AND METHODOLOGY, made possible by WORKING WITH THE BEST delivery team. OLLIVER'S DESTINY NUMBER IS 22 AND HE IS EXTREMELY PROUD TO BE BORN WITH THIS ENERGY AND DESTINY OF LIFE
MAYBE THIS WILL ALL MAKE SENSE NOW?
THE DESTINY NUMBER 22 (AKA ‘EXPRESSION NUMBER 22’) IS CONSIDERED A MASTER NUMBER. IT CAN BE KEPT AS A DOUBLE-DIGIT NUMBER OR REDUCED DOWN TO A SINGLE DIGIT (FOUR). THIS NUMBER IS CONSIDERED THE MASTER BUILDER, AND PEOPLE WITH THIS DESTINY NUMBER WILL LIKELY REACH AND SURPASS ALL THEIR DREAMS WHILE MAKING A STRONG IMPACT ON OTHERS. TWENTY-TWOS WILL ASSUME GREAT RESPONSIBILITY DURING LIFE, AND THEIR HUGE ACHIEVEMENTS AND UNDERTAKINGS WILL GIVE THEM FAR-REACHING NOTORIETY. THEY WILL INFLUENCE THE WORLD IN A PRACTICAL WAY, AND OFTEN BECOME VERY WEALTHY AND SUCCESSFUL.
THE EXPRESSION NUMBER 22 PERSONALITY…
PEOPLE WITH THE MASTER NUMBER 22 ARE BORN KNOWING WHAT THEY MUST ACCOMPLISH. THEY HAVE A SENSE OF THE TYPE OF IMPACT THEY CAN MAKE, BUT THE SHEER AMOUNT OF EFFORT AND TIME MAKES THEM DUBIOUS OF THEIR ABILITIES. BECAUSE OF THE LARGE RESPONSIBILITIES THAT A 22 WILL FACE, SOME CHOOSE TO SETTLE AS A DESTINY NUMBER FOUR. IF THIS ROUTE IS CHOSEN, THERE WILL ALWAYS BE AN EMOTIONAL TUG AND PULL. THEIR TALENTS AND LEADERSHIP SKILLS ARE FAR-REACHING, AND THEY WILL BE THE MOST SUCCESSFUL OF ALL DESTINY NUMBERS.
TWENTY-TWOS ARE DISCIPLINED, HARD-WORKING, FAIR, DRIVEN, SUCCESSFUL, CONFIDENT, PRACTICAL, INTUITIVE, HONEST, INDEPENDENT AND POWERFUL. THEY ARE A UNIQUE COMBINATION OF DESTINY NUMBERS 11 AND FOUR. ELEVENS ARE KNOWN FOR THEIR STRONG INTUITION AND FOURS FOR THEIR PRACTICALITY. THESE TRAITS WORK IN TANDEM TO CREATE A PERSON WHO IS BOTH LEVEL HEADED AND FOCUSED. TWENTY-TWOS ARE FULL OF BIG IDEAS, AND THEY ARE THE MOST LIKELY OF ALL THE DESTINY NUMBERS TO ACCOMPLISH THEM. A STRONG SENSE OF SELF-CONFIDENCE WILL ALLOW THEM TO BE BOLD LEADERS.
THEY ARE EXCELLENT COMMUNICATORS THAT HAVE A SENSITIVE SIDE. THEIR THICK SKIN MAKES THEM APPEAR LESS VULNERABLE, AND THEY’RE MORE RESISTANT TO CRITICISM.
EVEN THOUGH A 22 SEEMS PREDESTINED TO MAKE ALL THEIR IDEAS REALITIES, THEY CAN LACK ENOUGH PERSEVERANCE FOR THEIR DREAMS TO TAKE SHAPE. THEIR POTENTIAL CAN BE WASTED IF THEY LACK AMBITION OR BECOME OVERWHELMED BY THEIR PATH. THIS COULD RESULT IN DEVASTATING FAILURE.
CAREER
ALMOST ANY POSITION IS ATTAINABLE FOR A PERSON WITH THIS MASTER NUMBER. BECAUSE THEY APPROACH SENSITIVE SUBJECTS WITH REALISM AND DELICACY, PEOPLE WHO ARE BORN OF THIS NUMBER MAKE EXCELLENT DOCTORS, CEOS, ARCHITECTS, COUNSELORS AND DIPLOMATS. THEY CAN MAKE THE TOUGH CALLS, BUT ARE SENSITIVE TO THE FEELINGS OF OTHERS. BECAUSE OF THEIR DIVINE INTELLECT, 22S ALSO EXCEL IN ACADEMIC FIELDS AND TEACHING.
LOVE
EXPRESSION NUMBER 22 PEOPLE MUST CHOOSE A PARTNER WHOSE AMBITIONS MATCH THEIR OWN. ONCE THIS PERSON IS FOUND, THEY WILL BE A DEDICATED AND UNDERSTANDING MATE AND FRIEND. THEY ARE EAGER TO HELP THE PEOPLE THEY LOVE TRIUMPH OVER THE TOUGHEST SITUATIONS.
ADVICE
EVEN THOUGH 22S ARE MORE APT TO ACHIEVE GREATNESS IN LIFE THAT DOESN’T MEAN THEY’RE LESS LIKELY TO FACE HARDSHIPS. THE GREATEST STRIFE THAT A 22 MUST ENDURE IS LEARNING TO PERSEVERE WHEN THE ODDS ARE STACKED AGAINST THEM, WHICH WILL OFTEN HAPPEN. THOUGH THEY HAVE A MUCH TOUGHER EXTERIOR, 22S ARE INTERNALLY SENTIMENTAL. THEY MUST NOT ALLOW THE CRITICISMS OF OTHERS TO SABOTAGE THEM ON THEIR ROAD TO GREATNESS. IF YOUR INTERESTED TO KNOW YOUR DESTINY NUMBER THEN ADD YOUR FULL DATE OF BIRTH TOGETHER AND RE-DENOMINATE IT UNTIL YOU GET A SINGLE NUMBER UNLESS YOUR A MASTER NUMBER I.E 11, 22, 33, 44 THEN DO SOME RESEARCH ON GOOGLE OR YOU TUBE PLENTY OUT THERE

"1542207112:::1580801897:::James Azrael:::Born on April 12th, 1978 to Roque ""Rocky"" (Father) and Rolee' (Mother) [having proud heritage and origins within the Sioux Nation, and Ooglala Tribe], James Azrael was destined to enter the music industry. At the age of six, ""The Rev,"" as he's often referred to now, began his musical prowess with the piano, but promptly moved on to become the solo upright bass-player for his school's orchestra at the age of nine. By the time junior high rolled around, much to the chagrin of his parents, James was drawn to the electric guitar, and began his new journey, his calling, in 1991. In 1992, James wrote his first song, ""Welcome To Hell,"" which was recorded for the first time, in a professional studio, in 1996. It took another 7-years to become James' vision he had 11-years prior. It was released in 2003 on Court Jester's debut album, ""GINA"" [Cellar Records]. For the last thirteen years, James has composed (music & lyrics) and arranged nearly 95% of Court Jester's published library of songs; and lest we not forget...Court Jester's rhythm/lead guitarist. And in 2003, they released their debut album (encompassing a decade of songs James had written), ""Gina,"" drew critical acclaim for their efforts and had put the band on the map. Their sophomore album, ""Stangeland"" was released in January 2006 and featured Dizzy Reed of Guns N' Roses on piano and Hammond C2 Organ. The album quickly gained popularity, with the help of the notorious Howie Rosen, and landed the group two hit singles -""Hollywood Girl"" and ""Needless to Say"" respectively - which ranked highly among two separate formats & audience demographics (Rock & Adult Contemporary). In addition to his successful musical career, James has also dabbled into the Film/TV Industry. James appeared in the a 2003 major network & cable commercial campaign for WAHL, Inc. alongside UFC Heavyweight Champion, Andrei Arlovski; James currently endorses WAHL, Inc.'s line of Beard Trimmers. He was producer for the award-winning 2007 feature film ""Farewell Darkness (winner of such prestigious awards as: 'Best Feature Film' at the Drake International (Italy) and Del Ray Beach Film Festivals, respectively. James is no stranger to the lens' eye either. You may spot him in such titles: ""The Birthday Card,"" ""Common Senses,"" ""The Break-Up,"" ""Roscoe Village,"" and more. Additionally, James is making a name for himself as a composer since his debut for the highly respected, revered and award-winning 2006 short-film ""Soldier;"" Film Threat Magazine wrote, ""...['Soldier'] is the second best unseen movie of 2006!"" Some may still remember James from his days as a Chicagoland radio (1992-2001); working alongside such great talents as Erich ""Mancow"" Muller, Danny Bonaduce, Lou Brutus and more. He continues to do work as a voice-over artist, most recently hired to do a ""book-on-CD"" of the children's book, ""The True Story of the 3 Little Pigs!,"" (Jon Scieszka) for the Illinois School Library Media Association. James provided all the character voices and narration, a score, spfx, even that infamous ""turn-the-page"" chime! James does all his own production, from concept to mastering. James has a Bachelor's of Fine Arts Degree in Radio Broadcast Communications and a Masters of Teaching Degree in Education/K-9 with an endorsement for Public Speaking.

Currently, with Court Jester on hiatus, James is pursuing new avenues, experimenting, and taking on projects of all kinds. James' solo work is available via Digital Distribution on over 40 locations, including: Amazon, iTunes, Rhapsody, Napster, LimeWire, and many more; and an ""iPhone Exclusive"" ring-tone.:::3618:::583:::0.16072649044795786:::0.3991985068072024:::4:::56:::2011|||"

"363167845:::746318505:::Jeff Tidball:::Jeff Tidball decided in 7th grade that he'd grow up to be a professional game designer, so that's what he did.

He worked for Atlas Games from 1995–2000, managing Ars Magica's fourth edition and taking care of a little bit of everything else. In 2000, he relocated to Los Angeles to earn an MFA in screenwriting from the University of Southern California. Afterward, he wrote screenplays while day-jobbing for the likes of Decipher on The Lord of the Rings Roleplaying Game and mobile game start-up Tomo Software on a ""massively mobile"" RPG. He joined Fantasy Flight Games and became its Vice President of Product Development in 2006, co-founded Gameplaywright with Will Hindmarch in 2007, became a full-time freelancer in 2009, moved to Kansas City to become the CEO of creative services company RiverKey Creative in 2011, and recently returned to the Atlas Games like the bad penny that he is.

Jeff has won three Origins Awards and been nominated for a half-dozen more. His experimental design Pieces of Eight — a pirate ship combat game played with metal coins — was a Diana Jones Award nominee. Marquee designs include the FFG edition of Horus Heresy, the Eternal Lies mega-campaign for Trail of Cthulhu, and Alderac's Mercante. He's also very proud of his development work on Eric Lang's Chaos in the Old World.

"2059183754:::1007685652:::Sam Flegal:::I first discovered Norse Mythology back in 1999, when I was a Freshman in college. I'd gone to school out-of-state and didn't know many people. This left me with a lot of free time, and I spent it in the school library. At that point in my life, I was questioning religion, so I read about all the world religions. Out of all the myths and legends, the lore of the Norse stuck with me.

Throughout my art education I found ways to bring Norse Mythology into my projects as often as I could. On foggy days I'd even yell ""ODIN!"" into the mist on campus. Over time I made many friends, and spent less time in the library. Eventually I graduated and became a Graphic Designer. I worked in marketing for many years, but ultimately I found my way back to drawing and painting.

I've been a freelance illustrator since 2009. I've done art for the gaming industry and concept art for movies, but in 2012 I was faced with a client-free month. I didn't know what to do – I hadn't drawn for myself in years! After some soul searching and sketching, I started to work on a painting of a trickster wizard. At first I didn't realize it, but the painting was of Loki. Before the end of the month, I got more client work and never finished the painting; but it got me thinking about the Norse Gods again.

As many artists do, I started to feel a desire to work on more personal paintings. I was reading more about Odin and I felt a connection with the One-Eyed God. Once I finally had the time to devote to personal work, I was inspired to paint Odin holding the head of Mimir, and this became my painting ""Odin's Secrets.""

I didn't know it then, but this was the beginning of Fateful Signs.

Margaret and Stacy share a lifelong love for all that is mystical and mysterious. Stacy always had a desire to work with an artist in the creation of a Tarot deck, but until she connected with Margaret, she’d not found just the right person to do that. On the first day of one of Stacy’s Tarot courses, Margaret brought a series of paintings for Stacy to look at, hoping they might be considered as trade for the class. Stacy was immediately drawn to Margaret’s art, but particularly to one painting: it was the image of a ghostly woman, standing in a field of flowers. All around the woman’s head, were swirls and spinning circles. Stacy had always seen the world in this way, and she immediately was drawn to Margaret’s style of art. At the end of the course, Margaret approached Stacy about the possibility of co-creating a Tarot deck. They were so excited to envision themselves in such a mystical collaboration that Margaret wasted no time in ordering the materials to stretch 78 canvases.

Since then the Blind Beggar has added regular releases to those initial ranges of Pulp, Old West and Cthulhu Mythos themed miniatures.

2016 saw the introduction of the 'Outlanders' sci-fi setting, a range of figures suitable for classic sci-fi gaming that also work perfectly well for the Post-Apocalypse and Steampunk genres.

2017 saw the first of the Android Collectives come off of the production line. There are now almost thirty models in the range already and more are planned.

Susten-Table abré sus puertas el 29 de junio del 2015 en Acapulco, Guerrero; en un pequeño lugar lleno de sueños y de pasión por la buena comida, cuatro pequeñas mesas con cuatro sillas cada una, las cuales esperaban a sus comensales con mucho cariño esperando la oportunidad de ofrecerles nuestra cocina. Posteriormente el 23 de julio 2016 con un gran equipo de personas pudimos crecer nuestra capacidad de servile a 70 comensales, logrando la visita de clientes que se convirtieron en amigos convirtiendo a Susten-Table en un lugar auténtico lleno de anécdotas muy especiales, sin embargo debido a la situación social y económica de Acapulco tuvimos que buscar nuevos caminos para continuar nuestra propuesta y seguir adelante con nuestro proyecto.
Hoy, Octubre 2017, gracias al esfuerzo y confianza de todo un equipo de trabajo, Susten-Table tuvo la oportunidad de continuar y abrir sus puertas en Zapopan Jalisco cerca de la Basílica, un lugar donde se trabajó día a día con mucho esmero para lograr convertir el espacio en las nuevas paredes y buscando plasmar nuestra personalidad en cada detalle para lograr ser de los lugares preferidos por la gente. Lamentablemente tuvimos que cerrar nuestras puertas.
Nos basamos en la cocina artesanal, ancestral, buscando rescatar los procesos cuando la comida era el principal motivo de reunión e implicaba largos procesos manuales manejando productos naturales, mientras buscamos incluir productos hechos en casa por manos creativas, usando una manufactura casi igual a la de las abuelas pero con ayuda de la tecnología. Por esto también parte del proyecto, es nuestro Huerto Urbano. Pretendemos poder cultivar alrededor de 300 plantas comestibles para poner “la cosecha en tu mesa”, garantizando su frescura y cero fertilizantes químicos. También contaremos con nuestra pequeña sección de panadería donde es molido cada grano de trigo para ser convertido en harina integral, con la cual elaboramos el pan cada mañana. Se prepara un estilo de pan dulce y otro salado, pan de caja y bollos con los cuales preparamos nuestros sándwiches, tapas y hamburguesas con verduras.
Quienes nos han conocido pueden notar que nuestra cocina es transparente, para que nuestros clientes puedan ver como se trabaja dentro de ella y la manipulación de los alimentos. Somos un pequeño equipo de personas, una familia con mucho entusiasmo y fe, buscamos ofrecerles la mayor calidad en cada cosa que hacemos.
Nuestra cocina “slow food” es de autor, artesanal; hecha con las manos y con el corazón.:::2828:::453:::-0.020512820512820516:::0.035897435897435895:::1:::0:::2018|||"

I put Vinegar and Lime in a batch and it was delicious. Ever since them I have tinkered with the recipe and have come up with what you see today, Crazy Lime Salsa. I have made it every Christmas and handed it out to family and friends. Everyone that has tasted my salsa has said that you need to can it and sell the salsa. So I did. Now we will work on getting it out to everyone to taste. Once you taste it you will be hooked. The Salsa has Tomatoes, Red Onion, Lime, Vinegar, Cilantro, Garlic, Jalapeno and Green Chilies.

After many attempts to find success in the genres of rock and metal, Corey decided it was time for a reinvention and began writing pop songs with today’s audience in mind.

The tracks swing effortlessly in the canyons of hope and sadness; each song sending out a personal message of conviction while tackling familiar topics of anguish, introspection, the celebration of life, and the human condition.
	Corey is approaching the release of his debut solo album “I Wouldn’t”. He is currently booking shows around the Billings, Bozeman, Butte area of Montana, and can be found on Facebook, YouTube, SoundCloud, Spotify and Apple Music.

"2061272608:::367968510:::Kirsty McGee:::From activist beginnings, singer-songwriter Kirsty McGee has toured the UK and Europe for 15 years, releasing 7 albums. With a voice that has been described as having the texture of ‘smoke and velvet’, McGee’s ever-evolving sound has been called ‘filmic, joyful and dirty, with hints of gospel and blues’. An innate curiousity, a DIY ethic and an abiding love of the Great American Songbook have produced music that is hard to categorise but difficult to ignore.

Collaborators in McGee's band the Hobopop Collective have included New York jazz legend Marc Ribot (Tom Waits) and Bluenote signed players Nick Blacka and Rob Turner (Go Go Penguin). Proud to be an independent artist, McGee & The Collective have adopted a DIY approach to music since 2007. As a non-mainstream artist, releasing her records independently on her own label allows McGee and the band to retain their artistic freedom. In 2013, the song Sandman was featured on UK film maker Danny Boyle’s Trance, something that shows the high regard that this music is capable of attracting just given the right exposure and a generous dose of good luck. 2019 sees the release of McGee's 8th studio album and her first UK tour in a number of years. As the label and the artist are both defiantly DIY, a little extra money is needed to give the recordings the final push into the real world.:::1352:::240:::0.1598549983966651:::0.47010822510822514:::2:::4:::2014|||"

Throughout his 30 year career he has worked at the smallest hills and the most expansive resorts in North America. He has left his mark in South America, Australia, Asia and Europe too. And even if you have never shared a bottomless powder day with him, he has always been close by. Maybe even in your pocket. Jim has extensively researched, photographed and illustrated nearly every ski map in the last three decades. Ski Magazine regularly ranks the Top 50 resorts in North America. Jim has 45 of them. His tools of choice are a camera, a notepad, a paintbrush and a canvas. Every painstaking detail - peaks, cliffs, trees and shadows – is painted by hand. Jim's large and beautiful paintings have helped generations of skiers navigate and capture the unique character of each mountain. He has had more impact on the popular image and feel of skiing than almost anyone. Yet few people have ever heard his name. It is because of Jim that trail maps from Aspen to Whistler have the same look and feel. This is Jim’s story of skiing told through the greatest mountain terrain in the world.

While working full time, and raising a family she remained relentless to the goal; saving pregnant mares and orphaned foals from abuse, abandonment and a trip to the slaughterhouse.

Then the miracles began to happen. The rescued horses demonstrated their gifts of healing and comforting. It has been well documented the remarkable and life-changing experiences horse share in a therapeutic setting. The organization started developing children’s programs enabling the unwanted horse to heal the troubled child.

Our experiences have been so profound, so healing and life-changing for so many, we felt our next step is to share the miracles with everyone.

"529624630:::1636666719:::outdoor element:::I am Mike Mojica. I started Outdoor Element, an adventure survival gear company, in 2012. I worked with a buddy developing new paracord bracelets. Together, we launched The Kodiak, a fire-starting true survival paracord bracelet on Kickstarter. In 2015 Mike decided to get a little more serious about the company and brought on Joe Brown as a partner. Since then we have been developing several products. We fulfilled the previous project the ""firebiner"" in May 2017. We have produced and delivered over 150K units. Mojica is constantly designing new outdoor gear. We also brought the industry the Phoenix Talon and Feather to the market. We do our best to listen to feedback. We met with some first responders and Fire Escape is the result of that conversation. We are located in Centennial, CO.

Mike is an outdoor enthusiast, a dedicated family man, and one heck of an engineer. He holds various product patents and has plentiful experience designing products in the medical, aerospace, and outdoor industries, in addition to Outdoor Element’s outdoor/survival products. He is always thinking of new ideas and ways to improve existing products. It is hard for Mike to not think of ways to improve upon the things he wears and uses. He is also constantly thinking of ideas for new products. It is just his nature.

Joe is a dedicated family guy and a successful business operations executive. He has developed thousands of CPG products over his career and has had the good fortune of being involved with several high-growth companies. Joe and his family love the outdoors and have decided to make Colorado their home. Each of Joe’s three children were born in a different state, all prior to Colorado.

Mike and Joe were introduced by a mutual friend and the rest is history. Their skill sets are very complimentary and they are ready to take Outdoor Element into its next phase. Fun fact – both Mike and Joe speak fluent Chinese, although Mike may be a little rustier than Joe. That language skill certainly does help when working with Chinese factories on production.

"887971344:::1034200812:::Festival Zanate:::Festival Zanate nació en 2008 de una manera muy espontánea. Desde un inicio nos planteamos una premisa y ésta se ha convertido en nuestra principal característica. No aspirábamos a ser un festival grande en tamaño, pero si en calidad, un lugar donde pudiéramos proyectar la actualidad del cine documental de nuestro país. Planteamos un festival hecho por realizadores para realizadores y público, donde el documental fuera el protagonista, donde cada proyección fuera única y especial. Queríamos un festival del que los documentalistas de todo el país, y el público colimense, se pudieran apropiar y disfrutar.

A lo largo de 10 años, Festival Zanate ha logrado incentivar la formación de público en el género documental en el Estado de Colima e impulsar la producción local de documentales a través también de la formación y exhibición continúa.

Festival Zanate es un proyecto independiente, lo que permite una libertad editorial y de contenidos imprescindible para seleccionar, promover y exhibir el documental mexicano.

NUESTRO MANIFIESTO
“Apostamos por el documental como un cine transformador, reflexivo, incluyente. Como un reflejo de lo que somos como sociedad, pero también como individuos. Como el retrato de nuestra realidad convulsionada, en un país convulsionado; pero también, como un cine personal que escarbe en lo más profundo de nosotros. Como arte, como expresión, como propaganda. Apostamos por el cine documental mexicano, porque creemos en él”.:::1474:::227:::-0.008333333333333333:::0.03333333333333333:::1:::1:::2017|||"

(3 months before a major flood) Became an assistant Manager of a appliance store (Rex T.V.) 1995 and led the national company in extended warrantees till 1997. Started Chess Empire LLC in 2004 and it became the first chess board variant to ever gain an endorsement from the U.S. Chess Federation. ""Dr.Ruth"" Westheimer loved our board game at the 100th anniversary of the International Toy Fair in N.Y.C. 2004.

My family and I lost everything to three floods in an eighteen month time span from 2004-2006 including our home which was headquarters to Chess Empire LLC.

Went to work for a medical transport company in Binghamton in 2009 and was injured when a patient fell from a power lift failure. I dove underneath the patient; he landed on top of me and I severely injured my neck. Our work doctor (after an M.R.I. was performed) claimed it was just bone spurs and sent me back to work. Two days later, I lifted a patient (weighing 450lbs whom I transferred 20 times before the neck injury) and destroyed my entire left shoulder. The Doctor neglected to show me that I originally suffered two herniated disks in my neck (from the MRI) which allowed the shoulder injury to occur.

After being labeled as disabled (100%) in 2009, I studied the casino industry in an attempt to keep working and survive my family. Now I am ready to finish what I started three years ago....by providing high quality & exciting new table games to casinos across the globe. I have their ""missing links"" which would provide casinos with instant and continued traffic. I have always know that life is not a game and that unforeseen occurrences can happen to anyone. I do stand behind one truth...You only need to win by one point. Keep throwing punches to the wind until you hit your target. Never quit on yourself and your endeavors in life and you will be back on top in no time!!

You can help us go from 'Mission Impossible' to ""Mission Accomplished' because my table games and I are ready.......Are you!!

Remember....In the game of life, you only need to win by ONE!!

He holds a BA in Marketing from Olivet College. His progression has been from music to reality tv, where he started Detroit Reality TV and produced Detroit’s first black reality show. After a successful reality show named “HOOD CHICKS” (his version of Bad Girls Club), which aired in over 130 cities, Ashei transitioned into filmmaking. In his first year of filmmaking his peers in the industry nicknamed him “The Guerrilla King” because of the run and gun filming style that he brought from reality tv. As an artist, Ashei’s work focuses on bringing the “black experience” to society at large. His first feature film, The Come Up, follows a guy newly released from prison and his struggle to become successful...legitimately, while maneuvering through an environment set up for him to fail. The film stars several notable black celebrities such as Carl Payne from “Martin”, Spanky Hayes from Nick Canon’s Wild’n Out, Haha Davis, and a host of other famous Detroit artists. His “Lights, Camera, ACTION” motto is evidenced by him releasing project after project with his own budgets. He’s released his films in theaters, museums, private halls, Comcast, and now he has a release available on Amazon. In his quest to fulfil his “Detroit’s Tyler Perry” reputation, Ashei has founded a filmmaking school where he enlists filmmakers and actors to help him produce a greater volume of projects and ultimately give local talent more opportunities to become successful in the entertainment industry. He’s noted as saying, “There is a segment of the population that’s displaced. There’s not really any funding to help them either. But I’m not going to let that stop me. These are my people and we’re just going to make it happen the best way we can.”:::1901:::359:::0.15960244182900432:::0.33975057494588745:::1:::0:::2018|||"

"1756705717:::280385080:::Erik Hugander:::Jag ägnar mig åt dokumentärfilm för jag tycker det är så roligt. Att göra film har blivit mitt konstnärliga uttryckssätt.

Jag har inte särsklit mycket formell utbildning inom film; har under de tre senaste åren gått en enveckas sommarkurs på två olika folkhögskolor; Fridhems Folkgögskola i Svalöv och Sundsgårdens Folkhögskola utanför Helsingborg.

Debutfilmen ""Ett solvarv i Örserum"" (2017) var en långfilmsdokumentär om min hemby som jag gjorde åt Örserums hembygdsförening.

Under ett helt år filmade jag vardagliga och högtidliga händelser här i Örserum där jag bor. Jag la ner mer än tre månaders heltidsarbete helt ideellt. Film togs väl emot och jag stolt och glad att jag lyckades ro hela det stora projektet i hamn.

Trailern för ""Ett solvarv i Örserum"" och några klipp finns på Örserums hembygdsförenings youtubekanal.

I år har jag dessutom gjort några valfilmer år Miljöpartiet, de filmerna hittar du på youtubekanalen ""Gröna röster i Jönköpings Län"" och på min egen youtubekanal.

I fjol var jag på Österlen och dokumenterade en workshop om nyodling på uppdrag av Nätverket Svenska Kulturlandskap. Det blev en film på 15 min, mitt första betalda filmjobb. Riksantikvarieämbetet stod för pengarna.

Länk till den och andra filmer hittar ni nedan.:::1274:::197:::0.038461538461538464:::0.07692307692307693:::1:::0:::2018|||"

"564595905:::745807468:::Clare Thompson:::My name is Clare Thompson, I am a Writer/Illustrator and Painter based in Chester, UK. My artwork is handmade and usually figurative. However, I like to experiment with repetition, structure and form, particularly in my narrative based work. Common themes explored in my work include the idea of collective consciousness, societal structures, the fallibility of memory and the implications of being human in a digital age. I also create observational paintings that aim to find beauty in everyday experiences including portraiture, old industrial objects/places and the natural world. I grew up in Liverpool and studied Illustration in Manchester. After graduating in 2011 I continued to maintain my own creative practice, making work in shared studio environments in Liverpool, Brighton and Chester.

"557164583:::1482431367:::Polet Arno:::Depuis maintenant 10 ans, la Horde, le groupe de folk n' roll festif belge, écume les routes et les scènes d'Europe pour proposer un grand dépoussiérage de la musique folk populaire par un spectacle vivant, dansant et délirant. La Horde est avant tout une histoire d'amitié, forgée autour d'un amour commun pour la musique et pour la scène. Issus de milieu divers et variés tels que le rock, le metal, le chant choral, le jazz, la musique classique, le trad, les musiciens qui composent la Horde sont tous animés d'une passion commune : faire vivre à leur public un moment unique, en dehors du temps et des tracas de la vie de tous les jours. La Horde, ce sont aussi des heures et des heures de travail, de répétitions, de compositions, de remaniement, de perfectionnement qui ont donnés naissance à 2 albums studios, un album live, un EP et un troisième album studio en préparation. La Horde, ce sont des kilomètres et des kilomètres de route, pour passer de scène en scène et de bar en bar afin d'exprimer tout le travail fourni sur les planches, devant un public de plus en plus nombreux, à chaque fois séduit par l'énergie et la sympathie du groupe. Au total, plus de 250 concerts aux quatres coins de l'Europe.

La Horde, ce sont 4 musiciens aguerris, professionnels ou semi-pro, jouant sur des instruments atypiques tels que le bouzouki, l'accordéon diatonique, le violon alto, des percussions diverses mais aussi un ingénieur son et un ingénieur lumière réguliers, qui connaissent et maîtrisent aussi bien le matériel que le spectacle et les instruments joués. La Horde sur scène, c'est un savant mélange de compositions originales et de reprises improbables qui transforment chaque concert en un spectacle ou le public se retrouve emmené sur le pont d'un navire à l'équipage foldingue et quelque peu imbibé de rhum. Un bateau qui ne connait qu'une seule destination, l'amusement et la fête sans fin.

La Horde, ce sont de grands projets futurs, tels que la création d'un DVD live, pour fêter les 10 ans d'existence du groupe, avec de nombreux invités et de belles surprises. L'enregistrement d'un troisième album fait aussi partie des projets à venir, ainsi que la planification d'une tournée outre-atlantique, dans le pays des caribous et des grands lacs. La Horde, en fait, on aurait beau vous la raconter en mille phrases, il faut la vivre pour la comprendre.:::2374:::401:::0.08001893939393939:::0.28472222222222227:::1:::0:::2018|||"

I have been working on Hotel and high-end restaurants since 1995 (during my studies) and my career has gone well so far. Now, i feel it is time to put everything i have learn in something that truly belongs to my ethic, leaving behind something better than before for those who will embrace my journey in the future. In the last three years, i've spent a lot of time studying organic agricolture and i've been working on three different vegetable farms owned by the restaurants i was working for. I really don't know the reason why but, i feel a genuine bond for it and working in those farms has been something truly special (even, if it was hard like hell sometimes!). That's the reason why i decide to put the vegetable farm first in my personal four-step-to-glory project.

Along side this animated series, Samantha and Lisa have started to collaborate on a range of children's picture books, under the series titled: Panda Witch Books (1st publication soon to be released) which was created by Samantha as a means of helping to fund the animation...

"89989890:::357049420:::Jerry Trzeciak:::Jerry is the lead guitarist in HAMMERCAN and program director at iROCK Music School, which is a private music school located in Cranbourne North, Melbourne, Australia. He is a father, husband, son and brother with a beautiful family. He has worked as a school teacher for 13 years and taught every year level from F - 12. Here is his story...

I was born in Melbourne, but Mum and Dad were from Tassie and moved us back there when I was 2 years old. Growing up in Tasmania was great for our family but I always new I’d return to Melbourne one day. While living in St. Kilda Mum and Dad’s flat got broken into and my Dad’s hi-fi stereo stolen. He loved music and he was always playing albums from bands like Fleetwood Mac, Chris Rea and Paul Simon. Losing that stereo was the beginning of my Dad’s life long search for the ultimate music sound. He is not a musician but has a very well-tuned ear. I spent many childhood moments sitting on his lap as he tapped his foot to the beat, watching him and my Mum dance to disco music on a Saturday night, or working closely with him to set up his next state of the art piece of equipment. He trained me to listen to the finest details which has made me the musician I am today.

Although Mum and my Grandma played a little piano I was the first person in our family to make music my number one passion in life. In Year 6 I remember my school’s guitar teacher visiting my class and asking if anyone would like to learn. I’d never even considered it until that point. Mum and Dad signed me up and I started lessons. I would come home and show mum what I’d learnt, and she’d learn from me. The other kids in the group were much better than me and at that point I couldn’t imagine ever being able to play that cool Smoke on the Water riff or Peter Gunn theme like them. Little did I know how wrong I was and how my quick decision to learn the guitar would define my future and what I would do for the rest of my life.

All through high school I continued to improve. Mum and Dad said I could have an electric guitar for my 12th birthday if there was a car park out the front of the music shop. Lucky for me there was, and I got my first electric guitar and amp package from Barratts Music in Launceston. I was very happy. By the final year of high school, I started jamming with a drummer and a new music teacher arrived. His program and philosophy was awesome. All of a sudden I was in my first proper band, we were playing in the battle of the bands, touring other school and playing on the weekends. It wasn’t about theory. It was about playing, and I loved it. Little did I know how much his teaching style was impacting mine, even before I was teaching.

Soon after this my singer’s Mum put me in touch with her friend who was a professional musician. His band needed a lead guitar player and I was the perfect match apparently. Dad was a little worried about me playing professionally in pubs and clubs and being out late at night. But the boys in the band looked after me and as a 15 year old I started my working life as a professional musician, getting paid to play. Once again, I loved it.

By this stage I’d decided music was my life. I was studying music and music teaching at University and was on my way to having enough security to move back to Melbourne and play and teach professionally. I graduated with a Bachelor of Performing Arts/Music (Hons) and Bachelor of Teaching. That was 13 years ago and since then I’ve played hundreds of gigs, taught every year level from Foundation to Year 12 and released two albums of original music. I’ve led and built music programs in schools from the ground up and increased enrolments by up to 600% in very short spaces of time. I continue to perform professionally, lead music education innovation and love what I do. I met my wife at a school I worked at in Melbourne and we have a gorgeous little girl. I never forget my decision to learn guitar all those years before, because ultimately music brought me to my future family and wonderful friendships. I’m a strong believer in trust, and kindness and their impact on creating high quality relationships.:::4161:::811:::0.20309328752642705:::0.39128964059196614:::1:::0:::2014|||"

"1024814041:::830761372:::GoosbyTwins:::Kristina Goosby and Kayla Goosby are an influential twin duo known as the Goosby Twins. The Goosby Twins are entrepreneurs who co-founded Goosby Twins Stationery. They were born on August 2, 1993 only three minutes apart and raised in Gardena, California. The GoosbyTwins were the youngest out of five children; thus, they provided each other with company, security, and self-confidence. They are an inseparable dynamic pair that motivates and challenges each other to be the best version of themselves. Although they are fraternal twins, their individuality sets them apart. Kristina, the older twin, attended California StateUniversity, Long Beach (CSULB) where she received a Bachelor of Science in Heath Science and a minor in Child Development. Kristina can be identified by the ‘V’ mark on her eyebrow. She is the outgoing, witty, and resourceful twin. Kayla also attended CSULB and she received a Bachelor of Science in Healthcare Administration. She is the reserved, compassionate, and analytic twin. While at CSULB, they both were Division 1 Track and Field Athletes. Outside of school, the Goosby Twins pride themselves serving and helping the community. Their community involvement took a hands-on approach by leading by example through health education and outreach. In their spare time, they enjoy cooking, traveling, scrapbooking, and spending quality time with family and friends.

The Goosby Twins’ family has been their biggest influence and supporters in which they inspired the twins to set their own path in life. They spent over $300 a year on stationery sets and the options available did not meet their expectations. They settled every time spending money on what they partially wanted. The Goosby Twins also noticed the lack of stationery designs and sets tailored to women of color. Henceforth,Kristina and Kayla created Goosby Twins Stationery, a stationery collection.

Kristina and Kayla designed Goosby Twins Stationery to extend an invitation for women around the globe to network and achieve their goals; as well as, to create an inclusive avenue for minorities to plan their dreams and future endeavors. The vision of Goosby Twins Stationery is to highlight the diversity of women around the world. Furthermore, they aim to cultivate a universal movement to empower and uplift not only our generation rather the future generations to come. Their planner line is a yearly organizer that allows their customers to dream, set goals, and network while planning and prioritizing their day-to-day lives. The Goosby Twins hope to inspire women by including inspirational success stories of women across the globe in their planners.

The Goosby Twins thank God, their parents, family,friends, and supporters for their support and continuous encouragement. Without you, Goosby Twins Stationery would not be a success.:::2846:::446:::0.09218106995884773:::0.2228395061728395:::3:::1:::2016|||"

"452209857:::2068873527:::Dimitri Likissas:::Dimitri Likissas (1969) was born and raised in Belgium and has Greek roots. Around his early 20’s he moved to the Caribbean where his career evolved from being a graphic designer to a corporate director of a media publishing company. From that point forward he has turned into a full time artist painter and his creations have discovered their way into numerous private collections mostly in Europe and America.

His colored dots arrangements, transform imagery into abstract/geometric forms. He explores the unlimited potential of chromatic and tonal scale, visual planes and volume with a two-dimensional framework. Viewing his dynamic works of art is an exciting optical experience.

He is influenced by his popart heroes Keith Haring (which he has personally met as a teen), Roy Lichtenstein and Andy Warhol.

He has evolved from his earlier style which included a same single colored dot pattern with a superimposed subject, while today, the main element or subject coalesces within the pattern of labor-intensive, individually colored dots. For him, the pattern of dots serve as references to living organisms, atoms, i.e. the idea that matter is made up of discrete units. These patterned dots cohabitate in harmony. Many ask him “Why dots and not squares?” because for him dots (circles) keep on moving and rolling, squares are restrictive.

His pictographic arrangement seems to emerge ahead of our vision boundaries. As the colored spots matrix progress and retreat, undulate and combine, they imitate the way in which the universe works in the lively sphere of both the micro and macrocosms

Dimitri Likissas pursues color relationship and brings a considerable dexterity of color theory, a deep-seated sense of rhythm and formational aspects to each painting. Dimitri Likissas is a visual wizard whose art defies spatial constraints. He has developed his own optical language and inimitable style. With utmost proficiency he invites us to view the world as magical, fluid and invigorating panorama. Through his paintings we sense our universe with a new range and fascinating perspective. His style emits joy, peace and express convey a vibrant energy.

From nearby his paintings exuberate an expression of mystery and wonder. (From close we just see colored dots, our conscious can’t interpret what it’s seeing, while from far, the dots melt into a cosmos which we immediately understand.

His wish is to take his art observers on imaginary journeys as they wander and unravel the optical effects of his paintings. He says, “I hope that my art invites observation and lets viewers have visual discoveries.”:::2633:::427:::0.1107905810545562:::0.25558350810680003:::1:::1:::2018|||"

"2137579911:::519276214:::Arthur Sadowsky:::Arthur Sadowsky is now considered one of the top electric bass players on the New York scene. Currently, he is performing, composing, arranging and the musical director of “Arthur Sadowsky and the Troubadours” regularly gigging in Manhattan.

Arthur Sadowsky & the Troubadours perform a modern vision of classic jazz that is stimulating to the jazz enthusiast while at the same time very melodically pleasing to the casual music lover. Born and raised in the icy tundras of the USSR Arthur was surrounded by music and art from a very young age and knew this was going to be a life-long passion. Studying Russian classical music throughout his childhood it wasn’t until the age of 14 when he heard the music of Joe Zawinul that his life would change forever. Hearing jazz for the first time was the awakening he was looking for, according to Arthur “it was like being able to fly or speak to Dolphins.” He knew to pursue this dream he would have to leave his country. Arthur’s love affair with the bass guitar started when he was 16, he recalls “I was at a night club checking out a musician-friend of mine and the band was on break, standing alone in the middle of the stage was this sleek and sexy electric bass gently supported on a guitar stand by its neck. I was in love for the first time in my life and this passion will never wane.”

Through years of study, Arthur has perfected his craft as a performer, composer, and arranger and has truly created his own unique sound with heavy influences from the great lineage of jazz musicians most notably Duke Ellington, Thelonious Monk, and Joe Zawinul. “I can’t wait to see what is next for me on this artistic journey through life. I am looking forward to sharing my deep and passionate love of music with all of you, please stay tuned and never stop swinging.”:::1817:::337:::0.15876767676767678:::0.4228637658637659:::6:::0:::2013|||"

"123061731:::456811730:::Gerry Allen Lancaster:::On November 11, 1970, I was born Gerry Allen Lancaster to a single mom. The eldest of three I was raised by our mother and her family. I grew up in a low income, high rise apartment in the inner city of New London, CT. I found myself participating in YMCA basketball programs to keep me balanced in my life.

Although, I had an interest in other sports during my child hood, I was encouraged to play basketball by family members who placed an emphasis on my natural talent and height. By the time I went to high school, I had received just about every award you could possibly achieve at that level. Living in an area that was statistically low for black males to graduate high school, I did in 1989 and was offered several college basketball scholarships.

The following year, I attended Champlain Junior College in Burlington, Vermont. During my two years at Champlain, my basketball team went to the national tournament twice. After earning an Associates Degree in Social Science, I attended James Madison University located in Harrisonburg, VA with a full scholarship. I left JMU early to pursue a career in basketball in the European league. I played four years before a knee injury ended my career. Upon my return to Connecticut the street corners became my best friend. The drug epidemic at this time was at an all time high. For a few years life was Great! But we all know that life style doesn’t last forever, and due to some unfortunate situations that led me behind bars I was able to get a second. I went to work for a childhood friend who was now playing basketball in the NBA. As his Personal Assistant for roughly 11 years, and having been exposed to the life of a professional athlete, I witnessed a lot of unfortunate situations as a result of also, poor decision making. I believe if I share these experiences with others, could help them make better decisions in their own lives. That’s what motivation me to write “NBA Blues” The Dark Side Of A Dream.:::1975:::359:::0.09929978354978357:::0.2959933261183261:::1:::0:::2018|||"

I want to see birth workers to not only prioritise and really feel into their work but to also prioritise themselves and ensure that they don’t burn out. When we are organise; mind body and spirit, we are able to do and achieve so much more.

Over the years in my work as a social worker, doula, doula-educator, and mentor I have worked with birthworkers, and women of all ages who are feeling disconnected, tired, overwhelmed, stressed and very much working against their own rhythm and flow. Flow is a feeling of peace, of abundance, or pleasure and joy, and of ease. Resistance and disconnection is the counter to flow, and it is my dream to support women everywhere to come back to the wisdom and gifts of their own body, and of mama earth, starting with the daily practices in the ultimate flow planner.

It is my mission to reconnect women to themselves and each other, to heal our past wounds, to support birth and motherhood to be reclaimed as the incredible transition that it is. To support birth-workers to avoid burn out, and to foster a community that will nourish and support one another, and our earth into the future.

I am campaigning to print these beautiful planners that I have been working on for over a year, that have been beautifully illustrated by Catie of @spiritysol. All I need is support from you to get them printed and out there. You will be participating in radical change for now and for the future.

Once I was old enough to work I spent countless hours working in a burger place which I also maintained and repaired the equipment. After I started to make some cash it disappeared fast as I invested in my sound and lighting business built from the ground up. I adventually needed a good day job, so it was a fit career for me to work with wiring as an electrician. Soon the night work and weekly 9 to 5 was hard on me. I decided to give up the sound and lighting career and cut cold turkey. I sold all my gear and moved forward in my life as an electrician. One major goal I set for myself is to gain as much knowledge in the trade as I can and open my own company as soon as I turned 30. After my Birthday I launched ElectriCity Group and haven't looked back.

"432177685:::1446225243:::Philip Martin:::Philip Martin is the director of Crickhollow Books, an indie publishing house – small in size but great in spirit. Founded in 2008, our first book was The I Love To Write Book: Ideas & Tips for Young Writers. The tagline for Crickhollow is ""Good Books. Great Stories. Fine Purpose."" Go indie! I hope you'll support this project to publish a fantastic new book in our award-winning WAKA series, the 4th in a planned series of six 32-page nonfiction picturebooks featuring real kids active in endangered animal rescue efforts around the world. The goal is to inspire other young people to look for ways to make a difference and to develop a lifelong commitment to work to ensure the health of our planet.

It's a great project, and will make a real impact, we believe, with educators, parents, and kids.

And your kind support will help Crickhollow Books stay afloat and be able to muster the resource to tackle an ambitious but so worthy project like the WAKA book series.:::975:::171:::0.33290909090909093:::0.48997474747474745:::2:::0:::2014|||"

After graduation, I briefly worked in Corporate America having held several roles at CNN, Turner Broadcasting, and the Atlanta Hawks.

It was around this time that I launched Aubrey D. Lenyard Designs, an Atlanta-based, custom bridal design shop. I sold a wholesale line of bridal dresses to retailers in Atlanta and South Carolina. I also designed custom bridal gowns and dresses for some of Atlanta’s leading socialites.

Currently, I am responsible for building community and planning functions and some of the social events for technology entrepreneurs who are members of one the longest running, university-based incubators in the country.

MISSION STATEMENT

We are a platform that promotes cultural exchange through barrier-breaking encounters. We celebrate diversity, creativity and cultural heritage, focusing on the discovery of music, people, and places. By putting at the center the cultural mix, the unquenchable thirst for modernizing roots, we strive to feed content from diverse parts of the world in a circular way to promote cross-fertilisation.

The quest to bring us closer begins with music. We strengthen the interaction between musical actors of the center and periphery of the musical industry to improve skills and mutual understanding.

We want and need people to be the main fuel of this melting pot: open-minded people who are willing to engage in unexpected cultural journeys and discoveries, and to become engine for creation.:::1485:::224:::0.0665625:::0.16999999999999998:::2:::0:::2017|||"

"919049107:::450177743:::Munchkin Metropolis:::Hi there, I'm Roger Kolikas. I'm the owner of a small construction/woodworking company called Munchkin Metropolis, where I specialize in custom items for kids mostly, but I've gradually been growing in the gaming accessory industry. Fancy custom deck boxes are pretty neat and add a bit of flare to anyone's deck!

I never did care for talking about myself much, but since this is the only way you can get to know me for now, that's about it for the business side of me. I've linked all my pages so you can get a better feel for who I am as a person and the quality of work you can expect from me should you choose to back one of my projects.

On to the personal side of me. (I don't have one, I'm a mystery....if mysteries weren't mysterious)

I was born and raised down south in Mississippi. My earliest memories are of playing outside with a stick (Sword) and fighting a terrible beast (Pet hamster). We had recently moved to a piece of property that only had a well for water. No house, barn, building of any kind, we lived in a tent that first summer. We were to build our house during our first summer there. And we did! (Sort of...I mean, it was a single room with plywood floor and 3 walls, the 4th wall was just plastic stapled to the studs. But on that wall is where we had our wood burning stove/heater. (I've never been as warm in a house since, and we had 3ft of snow that first winter!) We had a 5 gallon bucket and a sheet hung up as a bathroom. But it worked, and I loved it! We had a 55 gallon drum mounted with a draining hose that had a shower head attached, so we could shower on warm days...cold days too, but I don't count that as a shower. It was more like scrub scrub scrub, fast fast fast, let me out!

As you can tell, I had an AMAZING CHILDHOOD! It was like camping all the time. Booyah!

I go my first job at the age of 8, as a gopher (Go for this, Go for that) on the construction site my grandma's husband worked at. It paid $2/day....and that was a lot for me back then. I could go to the $1 theater on Saturday, play arcades, get the LARGE popcorn/drink combo and watch movies all day long with my own money. (That's right, MY money)

I learned at a young age how to live broke, and I'm glad I did. That knowledge comes in handy whenever life tries to knock me down. I grew up proper and joined the Marines at 17. Stayed there a few years before coming home and starting my own company (Woodworking, right?....wrong!) Selling at a flea market. It was good money sometimes, bad money sometimes, but I was the boss (Of myself only, but still, it counts....right?) I worked the market and craft shows for a couple years before stumbling into a mom & pop Video store (Old school, still did VHS and only had like 7 DVDs at the time). I bought out the bin of VHS they had for sale (At a discount so I could resell them) and I left them my number in case they had more to sell later on. Business must have been bad, because not even a month later they called and asked me to offer a price on all the movies they had left. I did them one better and offered to buy the store as it sat. That store's name was Reel World. Little did I know that one decision would change my life forever. I took that store and turned it into the first DVD only store around (This was back in 1996).... It did well until not 1, but 2 large movie rental chains came to town. But, you know the drill (Improvise, Adapt, Overcome)....So, I made a switch and started carrying more games. More and more kids started hanging out at the store and eventually one of them requested I start carrying Magic the Gathering (In my mind, wth is that?) Fast forward a year and we are the only shop around running FNM and JSS events. I cut the DVD rentals down to a single shelf, the rest of the space was for couches, TVs and original Xbox systems (We had 16 and they stayed full with kids play 16 player Halo over the LAN). It was a great time to game!

{But wait, you said you've been woodworking your whole life, how'd you do that while you were doing all this other stuff?}

The answer? I never stopped, it just wasn't a business, it was a hobby I did for fun. I also picked up leathercrafting along the way, just fyi. Munchkin Metropolis is a company I originally started as a home improvement company that specialized in Children's playsets, playhouses, furniture (We did grown up things too)

Eventually I married and got talked into selling the shop.... 6 months later they had ran it into the ground and all the local kids had nowhere to go. Of course I had to reopen! They must have a place to go! Throughout the years I've had 7 renditions of Reel World Games (We added the ""Games"", but kept the name of the original shop). And just 3 years ago, I moved right back into the same building where I purchased Reel World 20 years ago. Life is funny sometimes. Now I get to do both, Reel World & Woodworking, in the same building (Different bays).

I don't make a killing, but I'm pretty happy most of the time (Except on Sunday, that's when we count the register)

Now you know my story, why not message me yours? I love listening to how other people have lived.:::5177:::1015:::0.1509833084394488:::0.4003405504501995:::22:::13:::2014|||"

Their song ‘Bloom’ was featured on Sirius XM's Jam On channel, and their song ‘Coming Back’ was featured in Relix Magazine’s August 2017 Issue.

Featuring an upbeat blend of Funk, Bluegrass, African Highlife and Jazz Fusion, these Rocky Mountain Boys harken back to the early days of the jam-rock scene that just oozed positivity which nurtured bands like Blind Melon, String Cheese Incident, and Strangefolk . Fueled by high-energy improvisation, the undeniable joy this quartet shares onstage and offstage is reflected by their devout and growing fanbase, the Amorons. Based out of Boulder, CO, the band has a commitment to consistently changing setlists, expanding their already extensive catalog of original material, and stirring the musical gumbo. Along with the deep instrumental blend of guitar, keyboard, trumpet, EWI, bass & drums, all four members are also vocalists.
The quartet, two of which are formally trained jazz musicians from University of Colorado at Boulder & University of Miami (FL), create a fresh and different set list every night to keep their audience engaged and returning to listen to what the four have to offer. Often creating intriguing theme nights for audiences members, in 2016 the band hosted a ‘Big Lebowski Night’ in their hometown, complete with two sets of original material, costumes, extensive production, and musical teases with covers tied into the selection inspired by the feature film. The group has also played as ‘Smoked Gouda: A Tribute to the String Cheese Incident’ multiple times, paying homage to a group from their home state. Adding to the history of themes the boys also concocted an 80’s-themed Halloween show in late 2016, featuring their first ever ‘Wheel of Fortune Set’ where they had audience members spin the wheel in order to select an improvisational idea from it, and the band would then play it. Amoramora has had the honor of sharing the stage with other legendary and blossoming musicians from projects like Melvin Seals & JGB, The Magic Beans, Jaden Carlson Band, and EGi. Members of Amoramora have had the experience to work side-by-side with fantastic musicians such as Jeff Coffin (Dave Matthews Band), Todd Smallie (The Derek Trucks Band), Alwyn Robinson (Leftover Salmon & Various Keller Williams), Mars Williams and Liquid Soul, Rufus Reed, Brad Goode, John Gunther, Brian Lynch, Art Lande, Greg Gisbert, John Daversa, Merl Sanders, as well as various members from projects like Leftover Salmon, The Mali Llama, and Analog Son.

My philosophy is to only stock and create things I love myself, because I feel that my passion for my product range is what helps me find others who are like-minded... who will also feel joy and excitement when they buy from us. Authenticity is a word that gets thrown around a lot these days, but I believe that my customers enjoy the experience of shopping with Popping Candy because I am kooky and goofy and real...

"954915625:::1299351500:::MUSE & MARLOWE:::A l’envie profonde et sincère de faire évoluer nos vies vers un mode plus responsable s’ajoute un sentiment d’oppression d’une industrie de la mode leadée par les marques de fast fashion, qui crée en nous, sans que l’on se rende vraiment compte, le besoin de toujours avoir plus, de toujours se renouveler. On se réveille un jour avec l’envie de réapprendre la vie au contact de nos enfants. Alors, on se dit qu’il n’est jamais trop tard pour changer ses habitudes et apprendre, créer d’autres manières de vivre.

Il est toujours temps de faire le choix de la simplicité, de faire du tri pour se recentrer sur l’essentiel, de devenir acteur, en toute humilité. Tout cela sans perdre la notion de plaisir, moteur de nos existences.

Nous sommes Lucie & Aline,
Nous avons eu envie de pouvoir connecter notre envie de responsabilité à notre amour de la mode.

Nous avons donc crée, dans une démarche sincère, une ligne de vêtements que nous aimerions porter, afin que ces notions de plaisir et de responsabilité ne soient plus antinomiques.

"1577288371:::727627633:::Walter Venturini:::Cecilia Frioni, alias Herrera, es una cantante, actriz, conferencista, autora, actriz de voz y bailarina italiana.
La actitud hacia el arte no tiene límites. Y Cecilia es un ejemplo viviente. Su plan de estudios muestra que el camino de formación de un talento natural para el jazz Bossa / Latin, también puede pasar por el baile y el teatro. Con solo 18 años, Cecilia se mudó a Los Ángeles para seguir a uno de los coreógrafos de la época: Alex Magno. A lo largo del camino de Cecilia, otro maestro desempeñará un papel clave: la cantante de ópera Vivian Hernández. Este encuentro ofrece la oportunidad de ampliar también al mundo de la actuación, que entra en contacto con el variado mundo del teatro: a los veinte años Cecilia cuenta así en su biografía colaboraciones con nombres como Massimo Ranieri y Patroni Griffi.
En 1994 llega el primer gran contrato con BMG Records, y el single Bla Bla. Tomado del álbum Alta Tensione alcanza las alturas de las listas italianas. Una passe-partout que le ofrecerá la oportunidad irrepetible de abrir el concierto de una estrella de la escena musical internacional como Barry White.
A partir de estas experiencias nacen otros álbumes que ofrecen una matriz de América del Sur, con el fin de llegar a un resultado que premia la pasión: en 2005 Cecilia es recompensada en la Ciudad de México, en una importante exhibición de música de América Latina, como la mejor intérprete italiana en el extranjero. La producción musical se vuelve intensa, y hay 3 álbumes que ven a su protagonista con su voz hechicera.
Pero la plena madurez viene con Papillon, un suave álbum latino / bossa que destaca el viaje interior del artista, magistralmente dirigido por Alfredo Paixao y Gianni Errera. El proyecto se destaca no solo por la interpretación vocal sino también por su valor cosmopolita; cantado en varios idiomas (italiano, brasileño, inglés, francés y español) Papillon representa un intento exitoso de fusionar diferentes culturas en un solo diseño musical. Producido por One E Music el álbum hace uso de grandes colaboraciones como la dirección artística de Alfredo Paixao, René Toledo a la guitarra flamenca y muchos otros nombres conocidos en la escena musical internacional (Otmar Ruiz, Angelo Trabucco, Guerra Massimo, Israel Varela, por nombrar algunos )
En abril de 2010, Cecilia promueve su disco ""Papillon"" en el territorio de los Emiratos Árabes Unidos a través de radio, prensa y televisión, abre al desfile para el diseñador Andres Aquino para la semana de la moda de Dubai con su canción ""Papillon"". En septiembre de 2010, Cecilia abre el desfile de moda Andrés Aquino en Waldorf Astoria, Nueva York.
Desde 2012, después de un viaje a Argentina, empieza a estudiar tango argentino y a amar el repertorio de Astor Piazzola, continúa trabajando en la radio como presentadora de radio escribiendo un programa de título Casa Cecilia que se transmite todos los lunes por la noche, consiguiendo un buen éxito.
Escribe un espectáculo titulado Tango Bohème que en marzo de 2014 lleva al Auditorium Parco della Musica y en 2015 al teatro Sala Umberto y registra por segunda vez un lleno total.
En el otoño de 2016, es el protagonista del espectáculo Galá Tango en el Salone Margherita hasta el 27 de diciembre
En 2017/2018 está de gira con la orquesta MASTANGO.
También en 2017/2018 está de gira por Marruecos y Torre Molinos con una orquesta multiétnica llamada Came To My Home.


Walter Venturini es bailarín, coreógrafo, maestro y dj de tango y autor italiano.
Comenzó a dar los primeros pasos del tango en 2002. Sus maestros fueron Osvaldo Zotto y Lorena Ermocida, Claudio Villagra y Romina Levin, Alejandra Mantiñan. También participó en cursos teatrales de tango con la coreógrafa argentina Silvia Vladimivsky.
A menudo fusiona su trabajo como profesor y bailarín con el de DJ; ha musicalizado en Buenos Aires y en muchos festivales internacionales en Italia y en el extranjero. Musicaliza en toda Italia y es el dj residente de importantes milongas romanas, incluida Tanguera, en cuya consola sucedió al gran Félix Picherna.
Mantuvo cursos de tango estables en Roma, Londres, Nápoles, Chieti y Latina; en todos sus cursos, el aspecto ""queer"" del tango funciona mucho, es decir, no es obligatorio tener en la danza un rol definido por el propio género. Desde 2013 en Roma, junto con su compañero de baile masculino Cristiano Bramani, fundador de Tango Queer Roma, organiza cursos de tango queer y organiza la Malquerida, la primera milonga queer en Italia. Junto con Cristiano Bramani, participò como artista en las ediciones 2013, 2014 y 2015 del Roma Tango Festival, en la edición 2014 del International Queer Tango Festival en Berlín y en la edición 2016 del Festival Internacional de Tango Queer en Buenos Aires. Sostuvo cursos de tango queer estables también en Nápoles junto con Aoniken Quiroga.
Participó, como bailarín y / o coreógrafo en las representaciones Bésame Mucho, Otra Luna y Efecto Tango, parte de la revista Tango Cabaret de la que fue director artístico.
Actualmente baila en compañía del espectáculo Tango Boheme, del cual también es coreógrafo junto con su compañera de danza actual, Sabrina García. Con ella, también forma parte de la compañía Naturalis Labor en el espectáculo Romeo y Julieta Tango, un espectáculo que es una mezcla de tango y danza contemporánea.
Ha actuado en Europa y en todo el mundo con artistas de renombre mundial como Alejandra Mantiñan, Sabrina García, Aoniken Quiroga, Leandro Palou, Fernando Carrasco y Pablo García.
También es el organizador, siempre junto con Cristiano Bramani, de la deGENERE, el primer maratón de tango queer italiano.:::5660:::927:::0.0008163265306122451:::0.04183673469387755:::1:::0:::2018|||"

"74965806:::1223281579:::Michelle Malone:::Michelle Malone is ""uniquely able to blow the roof off the place then turn right around and whisper a soft song that will break your damn heart"" (PASTE MAGAZINE). Compared to most musical artists in the Americana genre, Michelle Malone seems like a pair of distressed blue jeans amidst a sea of pantsuits. Unlike the surplus of self-professed rootsy rebels, one listen to this woman from Dixie and you know you’re hearing the real thing. A singer, songwriter, and guitarist whose music is informed by blues, roadhouse rock & roll and Georgia soul and classic vocalists, MIchelle Malone's performances can go from contemplative and pin-drop quiet to rowdy ""Twin reverb"" at the turn of a dime. Her passionate, uncompromising style has won her loyal following world wide, but most especially in the American south. She's a wild-eyed Rock Goddess, political singer/songwriter, passionate performer with early roots in the church choir – no single characterization tells the whole story. Over the course of Malone’s career, she’s collaborated with artists from Gregg Allman to John Mayer, Brandi Carlile to Indigo Girls, Drive By Truckers to Shawn Mullins, released more than a dozen records and went indie when it still took guts. Equal parts slide guitar slinger and sweet songstress, Michelle Malone artfully balances her penchant for ripping it through the roof with masterful lyrical introspection and vocals that range from sublime to raucous.:::1444:::238:::0.1765625:::0.37845238095238093:::3:::2:::2015|||"

I am a ‘Trindie’ games publisher, which means my games draw from both the Traditional and Indie pools for inspiration. Take OpenQuest for example. It is clearly a love letter to old school D100 games, but its streamlined with ideas from the modern storytelling games movement. Monkey which fits the mould of a modern day Indie story telling game, is structured in a way that people coming from older games will find comfortable. This isn’t vacuous marketing speak but borne out of hard experience. D101 grew out of fan publishing for Glorantha, with which I made the transition from the very traditional RuneQuest to the very Indie HeroQuest.

"1055028389:::1170262477:::Dogpatch Farm:::Out of frustration with our food system I started raising our own food in 2012 so that my family could eat antibiotic free, humanely raised meats. I grew up 35 miles north of Boston and though I always loved the city, it was obvious that I gravitated to the countryside every chance I had so I decided it made sense to live where I wanted to vacation. I never set out to become a farmer, I don’t think anyone would have predicted that, especially a hog farmer, but life has some funny twist sometimes. I love what I do and I’m thankful for all who have supported me along the way. I worked in the food industry for many years before switching over to working with animals by volunteering at both a vets office and a wildlife rehab. I now blend my love of animals and my love of food together as I raise happy healthy critters for the table.

Mulefoot Hogs are a critically rare Heritage breed and I know it sounds odd, but you have to eat them to save them. Unless there is a market demand, farmers will not grow them, so we can all do our part one meal at a time. Far too many animals have already disappeared from the face of the earth; I'm hoping Mulefoot are here to stay. I also raise small flocks of chickens for meat and eggs as well as Thanksgiving turkeys.:::1267:::247:::0.2595454545454545:::0.6000000000000001:::3:::0:::2015|||"

"890085155:::863241522:::Deanna Ouellette:::I have been a recording artist/singer/songwriter in Country music for the past 12 yrs. I have released two EPKS and a full length album which took me throughout North America. I have traveled thousands of miles and spent countless hours travelling/networking/performing/writing and recording. In 2013, after 7 weeks, 46 shows in and throughout the western states… I came off the road needing a much deserved break… personal time, learning and reflecting and asking myself where has the love gone for what I do? And coming to the conclusion… I needed to take a serious look at my life, both personally and spiritually. So I guess you could say I started my personal journey of finding my true purpose and higher calling. What does God want from me? What is the purpose of the gifts given to us when we are born? I believe God will allow trials and hardships in our lives, not to harm us but to grow us, stretch us, and form us in to our higher selves. The past 5 years have not been easy but I have had the ability to be there for family that needed support… be it a member who has suffered with Dementia/Alzheimer's, or a great loss of a family member, and this passed year battling sickness for 10 months and overcoming it and healing! Yes, this has all been apart of my journey and my families journey…. but now when I look back at all the trials and heartache and sickness I can see the beauty rise up through the ashes, how he has stretched and molded me into a more kind and hopefully more patient person. And it has definitely taught me to be still and know who God is and how incredible we are loved. To not take a single breath for granted, to love more deeper than ever before…. and to spend time daily with him… thanking him for another day… and to be in his presence and to be spirit led not self led. Through it all I have written some pretty cool and deep songs, the kind of songs that touch your inner core… your soul and I feel more now than ever that I am ready for a new project/ new genre/new name and ready to share with the world this collection of songs that will help heal and encourage, or just feel like you are not alone in whatever battle lies before you. That is my goal, that is my passion… to leave a lasting positive impression on a world filled with enough bad news… I want to bring light and love to this beautiful place we all call home. Hence how I came up with “The Siggy Robert Project” Now, if you all end up loving this project as much as me… get used to the name as it will launch me as Siggy Robert. This isn’t some alter ego blah blah thing… Siggy is my grandmas first name and Robert is my other grandmas last name… these two ladies are apart of me, my DNA, and both always believed I could take the world by storm and I miss them everyday as they have both passed on… I always promised them I would never give up and I feel so strong in dedicating this new direction in my career to two strong, beautiful women that have gone before me. So this is truly still me! Just a new, beautiful eclectic name for the new direction in the genre of adult/Christian contemporary music. I have been asked numerous times by you all - When are you coming out with new music? When can I buy your new album? Well, I literally cannot do this without you! The cool thing about getting involved is that you can feel invested in my music without being an investor! Together we can make this a reality and bring more light into this world. Take a look at the page and see which level of support you want to be apart of! This is it people! I’m ready to launch, do you want to sky rocket with me? I can’t wait to see you out on the road!

I learned to sew from my grandmother who was a seamstress. My passion for sewing started at a very young age. My love for sewing allowed me to get a distinction A++ in my high school days on my CXC national exam. From high school, I migrated to Canada, where I went to Seneca College to continue my studies in sewing. After Seneca, I stop sewing for about 10 years and went back to school again, I went to Humber College where I become a Register Practical Nurse (RPN). After Becoming a Nurse, my love and hunger for sewing came right back. I used to sew clothes for clients but I was not enjoying that as much. Then I realized my love and passion was teaching people how to sew.

In January 2018, I started my first beginner's sewing class. And I realize this was where my heart laid. The name of my business comes from the inspiration for the word of God and I love to dress Modestly.

"569963888:::727810666:::Jim Dodds:::Late in the fall of 2016, I experienced some sort of artistic renaissance. All the rough scribbles and more refined pencil sketches I’d been accumulating in a flat file since the 1970’s started calling out to me, and I started scanning them…and playing with them. And I discovered that some alchemy of better tools and years of stewing in my 60’s influenced brain meant I had something going. As I worked, old ideas generated new ones and I found I even had to set some aside for the next “generation” of my work. My medium is computer art that grows from my pencil sketches and photos to a multi-layered assemblage of often retro, maybe Peter Maxish, Mouse Studios, Grateful Dead era posters and, occasionally, excursions into logos and what I call lettersmithy. Those smaller images frequently end up incorporated as details in my posters. I had a show in February at the Three Mountain Café in Waitsfield and I was really floored when I was working in my studio a week later and I got a call from Rachel Jones, the arts editor at Seven Days Vermont, the local arts newspaper. She said she’d made a special trip down from Burlington to see my show and asked me if I would mind giving her an interview. Would I mind? Does a bear... well, you know. What came out of that was a two-page spread with four color photographs that ran with the title “Beautiful Meme-er.”

After the February show I started looking for other places to display my work, calling around to galleries, talking to people, all that. I submitted three pieces to a Call for Artists and was very pleased to have one of them selected for the Summer Juried Show at the Thomas W. Wood Gallery in Montpelier, Vermont. Every little flash of recognition stokes the fires, of course, and just recently I was invited to put a piece of my own choosing in the show “The Festival – Peace, Love, and Understanding” that opens on November 27, 2018 at the Bennington Museum in southern Vermont.:::1950:::362:::0.17646353646353646:::0.4007697857697857:::1:::0:::2010|||"

"1241276222:::1508809803:::Robert D. Jansen:::Dr. Robert D. Jansen trained as an experimental psychologist at the University of California-Santa Barbara, specializing in visual attention. He once gained national media attention by producing a video which lowered the blood pressure of the viewer. He taught experimental design and analysis as a professor at Palmer University in “Silicon Valley”, California until 2001. In recent years he has been producing psychoactive music and art graphics using algorithmic (e.g. fractal) techniques. He currently resides in Georgetown, Texas.

Dr Bob Jansen uses chaos mathematics as his brush and canvas. Although his technique uses fractal math and computer science there is nothing automatic or mechanical about flame fractal art creation. Actually, artists almost never invent their own instruments or tools: they merely use them well. An almost unlimited number of unique patterns called strange attractors can be extracted from chaos by non-linear iterative sampling. The task of the flame fractal artist is still the same as any painter: to decide what is beautiful or interesting. Most flame fractals are meaningless, simple, even ugly; but a few are stunning, precise yet wild, amazing beauty embedded deep within randomness. Originally developed by Scott Draves and Erik Reckase, the fractal flame algorithm is an innovative two-dimensional iterated function system that plots the output of chaotic attractors directly on an image plane. The flame algorithm includes as many as ninety-six converging non-linear functions, log-density display and structural coloring in combination with standard techniques of anti-aliasing and motion blur. These innovations maximize aesthetics by exposing more of the information content of the attractor than standard IFS’s. (A more formal mathematical description of Scott Draves’ flame algorithm is available in the web Wiki article on flame fractals.) The clarity of the final rendering depends on how many samples are accrued for each pixel during the sampling iterations. A large graphic coordinate may contain one hundred million pixels and may have required each pixel location to have been sampled one thousand times. The rendering process for such images takes hours of computer time even at two million samples per second.:::2272:::347:::0.1143671679197995:::0.3268421052631579:::25:::0:::2012|||"

"1682698950:::1064917212:::Jessie Young:::I am a choreographer, performer and teacher living in Brooklyn. My work manifests as a relational experience, whether an hour-long dance performance or a series of photographs documenting bodies in space. My creative process is a mercurial experience of constructing and distilling an atmosphere. I immerse myself in a process of slippage, collaging embodied and visual practices and then listening to the reverberations in the material. I work with a light hand, embracing a sense of improvisation and arrival as I play with habit and ritual as fodder for choreography. As a director, I look for the emergent substructures of the work, asking: What is the floor? What is the sky? What are the edges? My upbringing in the Pacific Northwest infuses a poetics of wistfulness into my work: melancholic affect, grunge aesthetics, and weighty landscapes recur as guiding motifs. Tectonic friction surfaces as I layer nuanced somatic attention with expansive formal dance.

The performances that emerge from this collision are chaotic ecosystems of durational movement that challenge the theatrical structure. I use complex spatial patterns and bold physicality to evoke a world of whimsical endurance edging toward euphoria. These works always exist in relation to my past dance training—of which I am in an ongoing process of reevaluation, attempting to build new frameworks for imagining the body. The tension in this reckoning creates the potential for an atmospheric shift: navigating volatile terrain, performer and spectator alike witness the malleability of reality and the liveness of the individual and collective bodies. My work has been presented by Danspace Project, New York Live Arts, FringeArts, The Current Sessions, Festival International de Teatro Susana Alexander (Mexico), Fleet Moves Dance Festival (Cape Cod), Krannert Center for the Performing Arts (Illinois), the Domestic Performance Agency and extensively in Chicago with institutions such as Links Hall, Chicago Home Theater Festival, Chicago Dance Crash, and The Inconvenience. I am a New York Live Arts Fresh Tracks Artist for 2017-18, collaborating on a duet with Jasmine Hearn and an Artist-in-Residence at Brooklyn Studios for Dance (2018). I perform with Abby Z and the New Utility and am in process Julie Mayo for her upcoming show at The Chocolate Factory (October, 2018). I have performed and collaborated in the works of The Seldoms, Kristina Isabelle Dance Company, Khecari Dance Theater, The Moving Architects, The Space/Movement Project, The Space We Make, Julie Mayo, Stephanie Acosta, Nico Brown, Sara Gurevich and Erin Kilmurray among others. I hold a BFA from the University of Utah and an MFA from the University of Illinois Urbana – Champaign.

"369408476:::48395326:::Sentieri Tolkieniani:::L’Associazione culturale di volontariato Sentieri Tolkieniani nasce ufficialmente nel 2008, sebbene alcune iniziative dei soci fondatori risalgano già al 2007.
La prima finalità dell’Associazione è promuovere e diffondere le opere e il pensiero di J.R.R. Tolkien, e in particolare la sua visione antropologica, la sua spiritualità e i suoi valori radicati nella cultura cristiana e cattolica.
Per raggiungere le sue finalità l’Associazione Sentieri Tolkieniani libera la fantasia dei soci nell’ ambito della cultura, in particolare del genere letterario denominato Fantasy, della teologia, dell’arte, dello spettacolo, ma anche della storia attingendo a piene mani al mondo medievale. Grazie a Tolkien, alla sua Terra di Mezzo e al messaggio nel quale, volenti o nolenti, ci si imbatte esplorandola, continuano a sbocciare proposte e iniziative che portano l’Associazione a farsi conoscere – e speriamo apprezzare – in giro per l’Italia e per il mondo.
I soci sono accomunati dalla passione per lo scrittore inglese che ha creato il mondo della Terra di mezzo, ponendosi come pietra miliare nella letteratura del ‘900.
Dalla sua fondazione, l'associazione organizza annualmente l'omonima manifestazione nel parco del castello di Osasco, a pochi minuti da Pinerolo (TO).
Dalla sua fondazione, l’associazione organizza annualmente l’omonima manifestazione nel parco del castello di Osasco, a pochi minuti da Pinerolo (TO).
Durante le due giornate ad essa dedicate i soci ricostruiscono concretamente la Terra di mezzo e propongono: spettacoli rievocativi, un percorso tematico sempre nuovo per approfondire e far conoscere Tolkien, incontri con i massimi esperti del mondo Tolkieniano, sia a livello nazionale che internazionale, dibattiti con i famosi doppiatori dei film tratti dalle opere di Tolkien, spazi espositivi a tema, rievocazioni storiche e molti laboratori e concorsi per grandi e piccini.
Tra le svariate iniziative che Sentieri Tolkieniani è riuscita a realizzare, e che si prefigge ogni anno di rinnovare, si elencano: concerti musicali dalle sinfonie classiche al metal, dibattiti e conferenze alle quali è possibile partecipare attivamente anche via web, piccole rappresentazioni teatrali, progetti per le scuole, gemellaggi con associazioni che perseguono analoghe finalità, attività di rappresentanza, la partecipazione con uno stand e svariate attività a fiere ludiche in giro per l’ Italia, iniziative di beneficenza, produzione di materiale video e audio scaricabile gratuitamente on line dai canali dell’associazione ad essi dedicati, nonché una webradio (Radio Brea) con la partecipazione e la collaborazione di ospiti sempre nuovi ed amici del mondo tolkieniano.
L’associazione inoltre si distingue per la grande varietà di costumi, ispirati in modo più o meno fedele alla Terra di Mezzo, che sempre più soci possiedono e sono orgogliosi di indossare durante le iniziative proposte.:::2914:::449:::-0.001136363636363636:::0.0625:::2:::1:::2016|||"

"759684284:::442886367:::Sally Jones:::My name is Sally Jones, and I would like to share a little about my personal life with you. When I was young, I was exposed to many forms of abuse which made me an emotional wreck who lacked resilience and self-esteem. I remember a time where I thought my spirit was broken, and I stopped caring about everything in my life. It is no wonder that years later I chose teaching as a career and was drawn to children with behaviour disorders and special needs (especially autism). After several years of waiting for that innovated new child protection App to surface, my anticipation waned, and I decided not to waste any more time waiting (as abusers claimed the dignity and mental health of countless victims.) So, armed with my passion to make the world a safer place, I created Safety Aware. This App has become my passion, my hobby and my life goal. There is little out to address abuse, and nothing seems to have improved the statistics. I aim to make something good out of what happened to me. It seemed like a positive way to create a happy ending to a sad story I urge you to help me on my mission, because with child abuse statistics being so out of control, it’s likely that someone very special in your life has or is experiencing the same fate as I did. Please pledge and help the youth of today … and heal the adults of the future. Thank you for your generosity!:::1372:::257:::0.0674264971139971:::0.3605654761904762:::2:::1:::2013|||"
"420750742:::1241315394:::carl:::Hello, i'm Carl Gayden, an independent music producer. I have 20 years experience in the genre of Hip Hop . 3 years ago I decided to create a children's music project. Fitness Fun is the result. A Parents' Choice Award Winning CD. This collection of songs explains the importance of daily physical activity, anti-bullying,positive self esteem, and more.I'm raising funds to pay for the manufacturing of 500 double disc (CD& DVD) set. Year after year my home state, Mississippi often lands in the top percentile for childhood obesity in the United States. I too have battled with my weight and I know how difficult it can be so I decided I was going to create some songs that will be fun, entertaining, and informative. It is my sincere hopes that Fitness Fun will continue to teach kids about this very important crisis (childhood obesity) in the U.S.

I have donated more than 1,300 CD's and 900 digital download copies to schools in my home state. Now with the animation version, kids will have fun singing while learning about conflict resolution,proper hygiene practices,making good nutrition choices, and more. This double disc collection consist of a CD & a DVD of animated short stories and music videos.

With your generous contribution to this project we will continue to spread positive messages to inspire, motivate, entertain, and educate the youth. Thanks in advance.

Al darse cuenta de que no había habido una feria de gráfica a gran escala en Oaxaca, decidió producir una para ayudar a proporcionar a los artistas gráficos una oportunidad para exponer y vender su obra. En 2002, trabajó para una organización en Seattle que se reunieron los tianguis orgánicos con la comunidad. Usando este modelo donde los agricultores venden sus productos directamente a los clientes en Seattle, empezó a organizar artistas de gráfica que residían en Oaxaca para vender sus obras a un precio justo. La feria es un lugar donde todos ganan; los artistas se conectan con la comunidad, coleccionistas, galeristas y compradores, mientras que los clientes obtienen un buen precio y aprenden qué es el grabado, y la ciudad de Oaxaca es reconocida como un centro artístico y cultural vibrante a nivel nacional e internacional.

Yoshi is a printmaker living in Oaxaca, Mexico since 2011. She and Leo Torres Novoa are the founders and organizers of the Feria Gráfica Oaxaca in 2013, 2014 and 2016. Realizing that there had not been a large-scale print fair in Oaxaca, she decided to produce one to help provide graphic artists an outlet for their work. In 2002, she worked for a nonprofit organization in Seattle that brings farmers markets to various neighborhoods. Using this model where farmers can sell directly to customers in Seattle, she started organizing printmakers residing in Oaxaca to sell their artwork directly in a fair way. The feria is a win-win situation, where artists connect with the community, collectors, galleries and buyers, while clients get a good price and learn what printmaking is and Oaxaca is recognized as a vibrant artistic and cultural center.:::1845:::305:::0.09083333333333332:::0.1938888888888889:::1:::0:::2018|||"

"1173066840:::722941798:::Mark Abis:::Mark Abis is a prolific and critically acclaimed songwriter whose work has been used in a variety of British and American television. He is probably best known for his song Summerbreeze, which was covered by Emiliana Torrini. His first album, 'Changing Inside’, was recorded with Adele's producer, Eg White. Mark’s songs range in style from folk to blues, incorporating elements of American country and complex world rhythms. From tender ballads to foot-stomping anthems, even legendary producer Joe Boyd (Pink Floyd, Nick Drake) agrees: ""His melodies are original, his vocals warm and distinctive, a real musical sensibility is obvious, with literary lyrics to boot. My vote for one of the best of the new generation."" Despite his international achievements and recognition by prominent names within the industry, Mark Abis is still relatively unknown; recording, producing and promoting his music independently. His new project, ‘China Ship’ with producer David Watson (Eric Clapton, Bert Jansch) will hopefully be a chance to remedy this; however, regardless of whether the industry ever comes a-knockin’, he will doubtlessly continue to pursue his craft. Mark claims that music is his “path”, his way of communing with the world. Those that have heard and been touched by his songs understand. A recent reviewer said: “Mesmerizing! Find him, friend him, buy his CD, cancel that thing in your diary - go see him live!” One day you may find him, playing in some backwater folk club and see for yourself, Mark Abis is one singer-songwriter not to be missed:::1557:::260:::0.20163690476190477:::0.3029739357864358:::1:::0:::2018|||"

Cigarette smoke, a neon-lit lobby,
a motel that smells like mold.
The front desk is a middle-aged man
balding, fat, in a stained white undershirt.
She, by the window in her trench coat,
considers everything and takes the Lord’s
Name in vain.
He, sitting on the couch, draws a cigarette
from his pocket.
She, standing by the mirror, applies a coat
of lipstick.
He, standing over the sink, rinses away the blood.

like this?
Looking for something.
A fly buzzes.













Death wish.
The flickering light by the sofa
steadied by the beat of his heart.
Consistent.
Cold fingers brushed her knee,
she couldn’t place the familiarity. A snake to slithered up her thigh, fangs tucked away, but deadly nonetheless.
Can I kiss you?
I don’t see why not.
He coiled around her neck,
her waist, and relished in
the warmth his blood
lacked.
Choked by the lingering
smoke and his hands,
she could finally breathe.
 
The underworld.

 

The institution.
 
Sympathy for the devil.
 
The realization.
 
Book the twelfth.

That was when the little detective,
all donned in her trench coat and black pumps,
realized the killer she’d searched for wasn’t
halfway across the country, mumbling into
his bathroom mirror.
He drove the car she sat in.
He kissed her with the same lips that whispered
the dying words of an equally deceived girl.

Failure.
 
THE POISON.
 
JUSTICE.

While also participating in a number of hands on internships at various places gaining outside perspective and experience in the industry. That experience is coupled with a genuine affection for throwing parties and making dreams come true for her guests. Upon going to her first vineyard in Florence and realizing their love for the land with which the food was produced and the French word ""Terroir"" actually meant something, she was hooked. Hooked on bringing that same agricultural experience and passion back home to Upstate New York.

"690743377:::1291183738:::Gary Showalter:::I am a furniture maker. I began to learn my trade in Atlanta, Georgia, in 1975, where I worked for just about anyone who would hire me. Several did, I am happy to say, and I learned my trade well. I moved to Israel in 1980, and in the workshop of a local artist who worked in exotic hardwoods I continued to learn, picking up skills in gold and silver smithing, and becoming familiar with the challenges involved in working with and finishing exotic hardwoods. Along with everything else I got involved in at his workshop, I was given the opportunity to work on several interesting restoration projects. In the last three years I worked for him I was able to restore and then use a Holtzappfel ornamental lathe. I loved that lathe. In fact, I loved everything about that job.

My family, meaning my wife and four children, along with myself, went through an unpleasant divorce that consumed my savings in 2003. At the end of that year I learned that my mother, then in her mid-80’s, was in failing health and needed me back in Florida. Once the divorce was final and my debts covered I left Israel and my children and returned to take care of her. I took several jobs as an armed security officer and even worked in a few call centers at night to keep the bills current while I cared for her. She passed in 2009. After the estate was settled, I was broke and homeless. Just to answer any unanswered questions, I am still in touch with my four children, who now have children of their own. I wish every day that I could be with them, but I could not pay my own way in Israel and I will not burden my children with my life.

In 2009 I published my first novel. In 2012 I published my fourth and last novel (all four novels are available on Amazon). Although they sold well and were well received, I was still essentially broke, and homeless, since the royalties were not sufficient to cover my living expenses. I think most authors must find themselves in the same leaky boat at one time or another. But I am not a quitter. In 2012 I took the job I have today in Dunnellen, Florida, working as the caretaker on a small horse ranch, barely making it on my $600.00 a month Social Security. I am seventy years old, 167 lbs and in good health. I enjoy working outside fixing fences, trimming trees, mowing, bush hogging, feeding the horses and goats and sweating. Lots. But that’s okay. I work for my room and board. It sure beats being homeless.:::2444:::457:::0.17771825396825397:::0.3548809523809524:::1:::0:::2018|||"

"590512909:::1563058847:::Sturla EllingvÃ¥g:::Historian and leader of Explico Historical Research Foundation. I have been working with DNA and history research for several years. In the past couple of years I have been involved with collecting DNA material in Kazakhstan, Georgia and Chechnya, which have resulted in some interesting publications about our European ancestry thousands of years ago. One article in Nature from May this year is titled 137 ancient human genomes from across the Eurasian steppes. I have also collected DNA samples on the Easter Island, which were included in an article published 21 September 2016 titled ""A genomic history of Aboriginal Australia"". Also two years ago, our team opened the tomb of the Viking Rollo's closest family members available, Richard I and Richard II of Normandy. Unfortunately, C14 analysis from the tomb proved that it contained the wrong skeletons, as one was 1300 years old and the other was about 2300 years old, not from the early 1000s CE as we expected. But this hunt for the origin of Rollo continues!

In January 2018 our team opened up a family tomb of the Altavilla family in Venosa, Italy and we are now waiting for the results from the DNA lab. This was also a Kickstarter campaign, which inspired me to do this project on Kickstarter.

I like to bring along expedition team members who are positive, with good humour and great spirits. We have a lot of fun on our expeditions, but I am also very eager to do serious and groundbreaking research.:::1472:::252:::0.08187530062530063:::0.18773749398749398:::2:::1:::2017|||"
"113891158:::2118042052:::Marion Hillebrand:::Nun ganz normal wie jedes andere Kind auch, wurde ich mit knapp 6 Jahren eingeschult. Ich war aber nicht sehr erfreut darüber weil ich doch lieber zuhause geblieben wäre. Ich war immer gerne draußen in der Natur und zwar dann, wann immer ich es wollte.
Es folgten nach der Grundschule die weiterführenden Schulen. Das wären Sekundarstufe II, berufsbildende Schulen I, Lehre und autodiaktische Studien in Medizin-Hippothrophologie-und einige andere mehr.
Mein Vater war als Maschinenbauingenieur sehr viel in der Welt unterwegs weil er viele Maschinenkonstruktionen betreuen mußte. Ich sah ihn deswegen leider nicht sehr oft.
Leider verstarb er sehr plötzlich als ich 10 Jahre alt war.

Mein Bruder und ich sollten nach seinem Tode Ablenkung in einem Ferienlager erhalten und dort fing meine Liebe zu den Pferden an. Das heißt, daß ich zur Zeit des Ferienlagers meine ersten 12 Reitstunden erhielt und unweigerlich vom Pferdevirus befallen war.

Viele viele Jahre später entwickelte ich ein spezielles Pferdeergänzungsfutter welches mir den Eintrag in Hübner´s blaues Band ""Enzyklopädie für VIP´s aus Wirtschaft, Politik und Sport"" einbrachte. Ich betrachtete diesen Eintrag und die überreichte Urkunde als kleinen Erfolg für all meine Bemühungen etwas Sinnvolles auf den Weg gebracht zu haben.

Ich gestaltete über viele Jahre hinaus meine Arbeit mit Reitunterrichtskursen und einer eigenen kleinen Reitschule wo ich nur Kinder aufnahm. Meinen Reitlehrer-Schein absolvierte ich bereits Jahre zuvor in einem mehrwöchigen Lehrgang an einer Landesreitschule. Diese Zeit ist mir in bleibender Erinnerung geblieben weil es mir sehr viel Spaß bereitete diesen kleinen Knirpsen das Reiten bei zubringen. Meinen Pferdefuttervertrieb mußte ich nach einem unverschuldeten Autounfall aufgeben. Das war sehr tragisch da ich bereits sehr viel Mühe und Zeit in diese Arbeit investiert hatte und meine Kunden allesamt sehr traurig waren weil dieses Futter sensationell war.

Ich habe in meinen vielen Lebensjahren immer versucht die Weitsicht zu behalten, was sicherlich nicht bei jedem Verkaufsprodukt von Erfolg gekrönt war. Auch über viele Jahre hinweg habe ich ein medizinisches Gerät im Magnetwellenbereich vertrieben. Erst als die CE Norm eingeführt wurde konnte ich das Gerät nur noch sehr schwer verkaufen, sodaß ich es für besser hielt mich nach anderen Verkaufsprodukten um zuschauen.
Dennoch kann ich sagen das ich daraus meine Lehren ziehen konnte.

Das Manuskript zum Klobrillenalarm z. B. entstand kurz nachdem ich die Lösung gefunden hatte. Ein Freund von mir sagte: "" Das kannst Du doch mal einem großen Hersteller von Klobrillen anbieten damit der Verbraucher endlich mal der Rutscherei ein Ende bereiten kann.""
Ich dachte darüber nach und fand auch schnell einen großen Produktionsbetrieb im Web. Dieser hatte jedoch auch eine Abstellhilfe im Angebot. Ich schaute mir diese auf seiner Homepage an und konnte relativ schnell erkennen das das auch nicht lange hält. Ich hatte alle im Baumarkt angebotenen und möglichen Lösungen gekauft und keines der Produkte hielt dem Umstand der rutschenden Klobrillen stand. Und dem großen Hersteller von Klobrillen habe ich mitgeteilt, da seine Lösung auch nicht sehr lange halten wird.
Ein Telefonat fand kurze Zeit später statt, wobei man mir mitteilte das ich mich doch mit dem technischen Leiter einmal austauschen sollte. Naja, ein Schelm wer Böses dabei denkt! Selbstverständlich habe ich mich nicht mit dem technischen Leiter besprochen. Warum auch, das man meine Idee aufgreift und dieses schnell mal patentiert? Ich schrieb erneut eine Mail und mir wurde darauf hin geantwortet das ""das Bessere des Guten Feind wäre"". Ich denke das dieser Satz alles ausgesagt hat. Ich werde sicherlich noch ein paar andere Projekte ins Leben rufen. Vorerst soll jedoch der Kurzfilm des Klobrillenalarms meine volle Aufmerksamkeit erhalten. Wenn dieses Projekt komplett abgewickelt ist, dann darf das nächste gerne kommen.

Somit beende ich meine kurze Biografie. Ich grüße alle Leser meines individuellen Lebenslaufes recht herzlich und hoffe das dieser kurze Text für Euch ausreichend erscheint. Eure Marion


Now as normal as any other child, I was enrolled at the age of 6. But I was not very pleased because I would rather have stayed at home. I always enjoyed being out in the nature, whenever I wanted.
It was followed by the secondary school after secondary school. These would be secondary education, vocational schools I, teaching and autodiagnostic studies in medical hippothrophology-and some others more.
My father was a mechanical engineer very much in the world because he had to look after many machine designs. Unfortunately I did not see him very often.
Unfortunately, he died suddenly when I was 10 years old.

My brother and I were to receive distraction at a summer camp after his death, and there began my love for the horses. This means that at the time of the summer camp I received my first 12 riding lessons and was inevitably attacked by the horse virus.

Many many years later I developed a special horse supplement feed which brought me the entry in Hübner's blue volume ""Encyclopedia for VIPs from Business, Politics and Sports"". I considered this entry and the presented certificate to be a small success for all my efforts to have made something meaningful.

For many years I designed my work with riding lessons and a small riding school where I only took in children. Years ago, I completed my riding instructor certificate in a several-week training course at a national riding school.
This time has remained in my memory since it was a lot of fun for me to bring riding to these little kids. I had to give up my horse food distribution after a car accident without a fault. That was very tragic because I had already invested a lot of effort and time in this work and my customers were all very sad because this food was sensational.

In my many years of life, I have always tried to keep the foresight, which was certainly not crowned with success in every sales product.
Even over many years, I have sold a medical device in the magnetic field. Only when the CE standard was introduced, I was able to sell the device only very hard, so I thought it better to look for other sales products.
Nevertheless, I can say that I could learn from this my lessons.

The manuscript for Klobrillenalarm z. B. was written shortly after I found the solution. A friend of mine said: ""You can offer it to a big manufacturer of toilet seats so that the consumer can finally put an end to the slipping.""
I thought about it and quickly found a big production site on the web. However, this also had a parking aid on offer. I looked at these on his homepage and could see relatively quickly that does not last long.
I had purchased all the possible solutions offered in the hardware store and none of the products withstood the circumstance of sliding toilet seats.
And I have informed the big manufacturer of toilet seats, as his solution will not last very long.
A phone call took place a short time later, where I was told that I should talk to the technical manager once.
Well, a rogue who thinks evil!
Of course, I did not discuss with the technical manager. Why also, that one takes up my idea and quickly patented it?
I wrote another email and was told that ""the better of the enemy would be"". I think that sentence said everything.

I will certainly launch a few other projects. For the time being, however, the short film of the Klobrillenalarms receive my full attention. If this project is completed, then the next may like to come.

So I finish my short biography.

I greet all readers of my individual CV quite warmly and hope that this short text seems sufficient for you. Your Marion:::7797:::1271:::0.029604079048523493:::0.19203243943984688:::1:::0:::2016|||"
