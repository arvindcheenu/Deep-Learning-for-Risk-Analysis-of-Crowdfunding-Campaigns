A factory work and high school drop out, Hartsoe became one of the industry's most successful independent publishers of the decade. Hartsoe formed London Night Studios, an innovative publishing company that launched the careers of many newcomers that went on to work for Marvel and DC comics, While manning the helm at LNS, Hartsoe brought marketing to a new level with many ideas now being emulated by the big 2 publishers even today. Hartsoe is an established artist, writer, editor, and publisher who laid the groundwork for many other independent publishers to follow. He created a universe built around his cult hit Razor that included such properties as Morbid Angel, Poizon, Knightshift, Tommi Gunn, and Stryke. Hartsoe has over 6 million copies of his comics in circulation during his career, a number that would thrill any publisher. Often referred to as the Godfather the ""Bad Girl"" comics' genre. The self-publishing legend broke new ground when he joined forces with E! Channel creator, TV exec Alan Mruvka and award-winning designer Marilyn Vance to create the comic book character EMBRACE with Carmen Electra as the model. In 2005 House of Hartsoe was formed to bring his comic book properties to the growing digital market.

2013 Hartsoe joined forces with film producer Jeff Most ( The Crow) to launch Most Publishing
a web, tv and film development division with Hartsoe's flagship title RAZOR as the first property development for a major motion picture from Most Films and helmed by The Fast and The Furious director Rob Cohen.

In 2015 Director Pearry Teo and Bleiberg Entertainment's Ehud Bleiberg tap comic book legend Everette Hartsoe to bring Teo's dark film spin of the Brothers Grimm fairytale Curse of sleeping Beauty to the comic book and graphic novel markets to coincide with the film's release and expand the films brand into many different ancillary markets.

"361794526:::929078952:::My name is Adam Reuter, I am a 36 year old husband (of nearly 17 years), father of 5 (4 boys, 1 girl), combat disabled vet (Iraq), and current corrections officer. I was born and raised in Iowa but moved to Georgia just as I was finishing High School. After graduating I worked odd jobs in the restaurant industry and some construction work. A few weeks following 911 I enlisted in the United States Army. I knew our Nation was going to war, and as a young, physically fit man I wasn't comfortable with others sacrificing while i reaped the benefits. Shortly following basic training and AIT, I met the love of my life. Not to get too sappy here, but the very first words i ever spoke to my wife were ""yes, I will marry you"". We married 4 months after we met. We moved to Colorado Springs while i was stationed at Fort Carson in April of 2003. In May my son was born. 3 Days later I left for Iraq. Despite the challenges I faced during my deployment, to include my injury, I feel they were nothing compared to those of my wife who was in an unfamiliar state, halfway around the world from her family (Half British, Half Thai), with a baby by herself, at such a young age (18). I came home from Iraq in Feb 04 and worked through physical therapy for over a year before the Army decided on a medical separation. Over the next several years our marriage had its ups and downs, I worked in several different fields. We continued to expand our family and both went to school. While difficult, we both prevailed. Her with a bachelors in Ministry and me with a bachelors in political science. Along the way I somewhat fell into working as a corrections officer, which I had done for nearly a decade years. I am now employed as a probation officer and finished the police academy in june 2019."

After moving to the ""big city"" (Norman, OK) I spent my middle and high school years making short videos and films with my friends. Shortly after high school I spent 4 years working with networks such as National Geographic, CNN, Food Network, ABC and traveling to film for non-profit and non-government organizations. Today I live in Boise, Idaho. I'm married to my wife Katie of 4 years and am expecting our first baby any day (April 20th, 2018 as I type this and no, we don't know the gender!). This pregnancy is what inspired me to make this documentary."

"1823553610:::879165089:::Everette Hartsoe started his career in 1991 at the age of 23. A factory work and high school drop out, Hartsoe became one of the industry's most successful independent publishers of the decade. Hartsoe formed London Night Studios, an innovative publishing company that launched the careers of many newcomers that went on to work for Marvel and DC comics, While manning the helm at LNS, Hartsoe brought marketing to a new level with many ideas now being emulated by the big 2 publishers even today. Hartsoe is an established artist, writer, editor, and publisher who laid the groundwork for many other independent publishers to follow. He created a universe built around his cult hit Razor that included such properties as Morbid Angel, Poizon, Knightshift, Tommi Gunn, and Stryke. Hartsoe has over 6 million copies of his comics in circulation during his career, a number that would thrill any publisher. Often referred to as the Godfather the ""Bad Girl"" comics' genre. The self-publishing legend broke new ground when he joined forces with E! Channel creator, TV exec Alan Mruvka and award-winning designer Marilyn Vance to create the comic book character EMBRACE with Carmen Electra as the model. In 2005 House of Hartsoe was formed to bring his comic book properties to the growing digital market.

2013 Hartsoe joined forces with film producer Jeff Most ( The Crow) to launch Most Publishing
a web, tv and film development division with Hartsoe's flagship title RAZOR as the first property development for a major motion picture from Most Films and helmed by The Fast and The Furious director Rob Cohen.

In 2015 Director Pearry Teo and Bleiberg Entertainment's Ehud Bleiberg tap comic book legend Everette Hartsoe to bring Teo's dark film spin of the Brothers Grimm fairytale Curse of sleeping Beauty to the comic book and graphic novel markets to coincide with the film's release and expand the films brand into many different ancillary markets.

2016 Everette Hartsoe will launch his biggest endeavor to-date, when the doors of Evolutionary Comics open with all new stories and properties. The legendary creator states that this company will provide intellectual properties that have a first draft script, design work as well as the comic book storyboard already packaged for film and TV. Hartsoe's The CURSE OF SLEEPING BEAUTY makes NETFLIX debut

Deduction Card Game, VERTIUM: Shadows of the Complex (SciFi), SHOOTERZ Hockey Card Game, STRIKERZ Soccer Card Game, WORDOPOLIS, and the author of Gold & Sharpe (a novella inspired by Get Adler!). I grew up in beautiful Cape Breton, Nova Scotia. Looking back on my childhood, I can remember inventing games.
At around 9 and 10 years of age, I used to sit down outside and show hockey cards to my beloved dog Spotty. I also made mini baseball games in the dirt with sticks and small pebbles. And best of all, I used to cut out those same hockey cards and play hockey at the kitchen table, with a silver ball for the puck: the foil from my mother's cigarette package.

Fast forward to the late 90's, I got an eye injury at work, which made me photophobic. I couldn't take bright lights and had to wear sunglasses all the time outside. I couldn't watch TV and I couldn't work on computers. The kids and I seemed to go back in time, and we spent many evenings reading, listening to the radio and playing games. Much to my surprise, I began to invent games again ...

I have had lots of help through the years, and I thank God for each person and each invention. I hope you will enjoy the games we bring here. Caper Games - bringing games to life! Enjoy! Randall"

In the beginning I had a million ideas and no construction skills. In fact, I had very little of anything, including funds, but for some reason, I had been infused with a passion and a determination that Burning Man offers, a belief that anything was possible. I had no idea how hard it would be, then again I had no idea how many new people would walk into my life and help at the very moments I needed help. The skills came, and I absorbed all I was taught and have now gained the many skills I was lacking. With hard work, tears and fights I brought art back onto Playa in 2015 and 2016 too. Bringing art to Playa with all its complexities and challenges made me determined to become a better artist and so I went back to college to study for a Masters Degree in Fine Art. But it came at a price, I have not attended Burning Man for the last two years. My finals last year were the week of Burning Man. But I passed with Distinction. It is without doubt that Burning Man changed the course of my life and has influenced the collective, collaborative and interactive art I now make.

In 2006 I went to university in Sheffield where I a obtained my bachelors degree in music 3 years later. At university I started singing and immediately fell in love with it. I loved the way it feels to listen to singing, the way it feels to sing classical music and most importantly, the people whom I was lucky enough to sing with. Opera became a huge part of my life and I was very lucky to get to star in numerous operas around the region. However, opera in Sheffield, and in general, is scarce. For your average South Yorkshireman you have to travel far afield for the passion of Puccini or the mastery of Mozart. It is this reason that I decided to put on an opera in Sheffield myself. I am currently working as a singing teacher in and around Sheffield and use my role to try and educate young singers about the joys of opera and classical singing in general. I also work as a drama teacher on Saturday mornings which I find very rewarding. I spend a lot of time with my friends, most of whom are involved in the project either in the cast or the production team and I love my family dearly, without whose support I would not be able to take on such an ambitious project."

"21843325:::1706342866:::Hi

We are Gary & Alison, a husband and wife team who create and sell wargaming miniatures. We started our business in 2007 trading on Ebay selling miniatures and component parts.

Since 2012 we have had our trade stand at many of the Wargames and Modelling Shows in the UK, which we have unfortunately had to stop this due to Alison's ill health.

Our first Kickstarter project was in 2015 when we also opened our own online store! Check us out at miniaturemen.com

Running MINIATUREMEN is our full time occupation and so far it's going well - we've not killed each other yet! We started working from a spare bedroom in our house but in 2014 had a custom made office built in the garden as our business expanded beyond acceptable house capacity!

Since first starting the business it has always been our aim to bring out our own range of miniatures which we achieved with our first Kickstarter and the help of our backers. Again with your help we will be able to launch and expand this new range and introduce yet more miniatures we have planned."

"2066895977:::13951586:::Based in Newcastle-Upon-Tyne in England’s North-East, Jason Friend is a professional travel and landscape photographer. For Jason, photography is more than a job; it is an opportunity to inspire. For over a decade, Jason Friend has devoted his life to combining his passion for photography with discovering the endless majesty of the natural world. From the rugged terrain of the Australian outback to the mountain summits of Switzerland, Jason has travelled the globe on a quest to immortalise nature’s most breathtaking moments. National Geographic, British Airways, Microsoft Corporation, Australian Geographic, Hasselblad and Rough Guides represent some of the many high-profile clients Jason has inspired and worked with along his journey.

Jason’s professional landscape photography is a dedication to our spiritual connections with the world around us. His photographs aim to convey the emotional experience of the landscape by extending beyond ‘pretty post-card’ visual appeal to engage and stimulate all the senses. Whether allowing us to taste the crisp, salty sea air from a surrounding beach, or feel the warm glow of sunrise peek out behind a rolling country hill, Jason’s landscape photography offers an enchanting escape route from the stress and distractions of our everyday lives, to an idyllic natural environment teeming with beauty and wonder. Jason’s venture into the world of nature and travel photography began with an image by landscape photography legend, Ansel Adams. Jason was captivated by the striking panoramas captured by many of Adams’ famous black and white images of the American West. Despite his early fascination with Adams’ work however, it was a trip to New Zealand in 1999 which inspired Jason to predominantly shoot in colour early on in his career. Immersed in the breath-taking landscapes of New Zealand, Jason learnt the powerful impact that temperamental light and weather conditions have upon the vulnerable environment below, and took this knowledge with him throughout his world travels and eventual foray into black and white photography.

For Jason, light is the master of his craft. His landscape photography is borne out of a deep respect towards mother nature’s ability to reveal the magnificence of her subjects in both illumination, and in darkness. Jason’s engaging images reflect a profound understanding of how light and shadow reign over nature, causing the landscape to transform with emotion. Motivated by the desire to bring the viewer closer to nature and convey this deeper insight, Jason skilfully captures his subjects in that crucial moment when form and texture is powerfully revealed through perfect light. Jason’s masterful approach to both colour and black and white landscape photography reveals nature’s most intimate moments to us, demonstrating his talent behind the lens, and his passion for the subjects within them.

“Time cannot be revisited; it changes everything in a split second. Whilst these moments can be spectacular, they can also herald more subtle changes. But one thing is for certain - this scene will never appear again. Fourteen years ago I left the UK on a quest to capture these fleeting moments. My role as a photographer is to convey these emotions, not by capturing an image but by sharing a vision….every trip spent behind the camera is special.”

Jason is available for photography workshops throughout Cumbria, Northumberland and Tyneside, and for commercial photography commissions throughout the UK. His stock photography images can be licensed via this site, and also his international agents which include Getty, Masterfile and Corbis."

"1618642281:::360183958:::Sole is a revolutionary, experimental hip-hop artist that has released over a dozen studio albums. He is known as a pioneer of avante guard rap and founded anticon records in 1998. He has toured the world multiple times, playing shows in Bosnia, Russia, Australia, North America, Greece and beyond. His breakthrough album, Selling Live Water is considered a staple of underground hip-hop. Not only is sole’s work a staple on many music blogs, but his work is heralded by many of the top progressive publications & radical media outlets. He has recently been featured in Spin, The Intercept, Truth-out, Counter Punch, RT, 2 Dope Boyz, Sf Weekly, Bandcamp, Denver Westword, Its Going Down, C-Span, Chuck D’s RapStation, Huffington Post, Tiny Mixtapes, and countless others. Sole is also the host of the Solecast, a podcast focusing on revolutionary politics, philosophy and culture. On the podcast sole interviews academics, activists, musicians, artists, writers, permaculturists, and everything in between. Prior guests on his show include Abby Martin, Will Potter, Astronautalis, Crimethinc, Daedalus, Frank Lopez, Mckenzie Wark, and many others. Sole’s music catalogue covers a vase amount of ground, from the post-rock influence of his work with the Skyrider Band, his early “experimental underground hip-hop” with producers like Jel & Odd Nosdam to his later more overtly political with platinumcertified rap producer DJ Pain 1. Sole is also a producer and beat-maker, and under the monicker mansbestfriend he has produced 7 albums that were self released and he later formed an instrumental band with his wife Yasamin called WHITENOISE in 2014. In 2009 Sole left anticon and began releasing records 100% independently and has since gone on to create his own label called “Black Box Tapes.” Upon moving to Denver in 2009 sole has been deeply involved in social struggles and activism and his music has taken on a more intentional political slant. Sole’s firebrand of anarchistic hiphop is truly in a realm of its own, inhabiting a space somewhere between the dance floor and the riot line.

Sole’s most recent album is a collaboration with DJ Pain 1 called Nihilismo. Nihilismo is an incredible journey between the duo of Sole and DJ Pain 1, first initiating their path together on 2013’s Death Drive and 2014’s Pattern of Life / Warfare. In every stroke of music and lyricism committed to Nihilismo, one can find a cross-section between revolutionary hip-hop and infectious club tones, delivered for a subversive dismantling of nihilistic culture. A weapon against the largest stages of greed and capitalism, galvanized to change the course of history that portrays the future world with a lack of sustainability. Sole & DJ Pain 1 recently scored the title track and collaborated with film maker Sonia Kennebeck for the award winning documentary “National Bird.” PBS used the song’s lyrics in printed hand-outs in screenings in over 50 cities as a tool to explain the horrors behind the Drone Program. Oddly enough, their critique of the surveillance state and the drone program landed them a performance on C-span alongside award winning journalists Jeremy Scahill & Glen Greenwald for the release of their book “The Assassin Complex.” This is the sort of cross pollination between art and activism that they have achieved through their music that sets them apart from most of their peers. Sole keeps the lyrical terrain thick and DJ Pain 1 keeps the music of Nihilismo glowing with futuristic compositions. Anthemic political rap that has flavors for every one around the world. Nihilismo is another impressive contribution from Sole and DJ Pain 1, reaffirming their legacy as one of the world’s most forward thinking and politically relevant hip hop groups."

Ever since he discovered his passion for music and poetry, he only strives for his one big dream : to start a career and make a living as a musician. Indeed, he made a rather spectacular entry into the scene, having his first performance ever on a stage with his Idol Ocean Wisdom.

From there on things only got better for Maz, having big success at Screaming Fields 2017 at Rockhal where he won 6 prices including the first edition of the Cactus Song Contest, as well as playing at Food For Your Senses, e-Lake Festival, Rock um Knuedler or a few Fête de la Musique stages he was also supporting act of French rap superstar Sofiane. His style can be described as very modern with a few old school influences, having a quite technical flow that's often accompanied by rather melancholic atmospheres.

On the 30th March 2018, Maz released his first album called „Immortalisation“. A sold out release show in the Floor of Rockhal Luxemburg on that same date has been the peak of his artistic existence so far. „Immortalisation“ contains 15 songs of many different styles that have been produced by the likes of Cehashi, Sun glitters, Corbi, Mr Charly and Fresh D. The album, which was teased by 3 music videos (on youtube) as well, has been received quite well and truly introduces the young artist. Now he’s hoping for a bright future, and tries to get it all „to the next level“."

"2593335:::32790899:::Molly Thomas And The Rare Birds have always been authentic but Thomas and her band have raised the bar on honesty and vulnerability for their new album, “Honey’s Fury”. The southern Alabama foursome amplifies Thomas’ recurring theme of our humanness, connection, and the personal transformation of our chaos and confusion into a raging river of sweet honey. During the four years of creativity that yielded “Honey’s Fury” Thomas has seamlessly woven 12 songs of love, betrayal, destruction, forgiveness, reflection, and healing into a powerfully inspirational album. Thomas effortlessly transforms the depth, range, and complexity of her existence into enlightening learning experiences that are touching and inspirational to her listeners. A notable example is Thank You where Thomas takes us on the wave of emotions surrounding her recent divorce, marital infidelity, and ultimately her path to forgiveness and healing. Her transformative and empathetic touch is most evident here.


Molly Thomas has always been a child of the water and metaphors of flow, movement, tidal change and bodily connection frequently surface in her lyrics. Born in Ocean Springs, Mississippi, Thomas has made made her home in and cultivated the majority of her musical influences from the southern regions of Alabama, Mississippi, and Tennessee. A hive for songwriters and artists whose emotive storytelling and beautifully gritty swampy swagger personify the region, The south has been the perfect location for Thomas to grow her self-described Indie Swamp Pop. As a side-person Thomas has recorded and toured internationally, including late night performances on David Letterman and Jay Leno’s Tonight Show with folk icon Todd Snider. Her violin, string arrangements and vocals have been featured on recordings and live performances with Guster, Matthew Ryan and Will Hoge amongst others, and her reputation as a songwriter, multi-instrumentalist and collaborator speaks for itself. Throughout her career, Thomas has released three critically acclaimed records as a solo artist and her music has appeared in films. Thomas’ current album “Honey’s Fury” is her first with her touring band The Rare Birds and it is a collaborative effort that first took flight with her creative partner and co- producer Rick Hirsch. Guitarist Hirsch, who's roots are firmly embedded in the Georgia and Alabama music communities, is also is a child of the Gulf. Hirsch’s career took off as a founding member of the chart topping southern rock band Wet Willie in the early 70s. In the mid-70s Hirsch recorded and toured with Gregg Allman and Cher on the “Allman And Woman” album, at which time Hirsch relocated to Los Angeles, where he wrote, recorded and performed with many legendary artists and music industry pioneers including Randy Newman, Glynn Johns, Russ Titleman, Tom Dowd, Billy Vera, Fatboy Slim and Joan Armatrading. In addition to many film and television credits Hirsch has had his songs recorded by Alabama, Tina Turner, Cher, and co-wrote Papa Come Quick (Jody and Chico) for Bonnie Raitt’s Grammy nominated “Luck Of The Draw” album. Like waterways that meander through the land eventually meeting in the Gulf, Rick Hirsch and Molly Thomas were meant to meet, and on many occasions, Hirsch’s name was brought to Thomas’ attention as a potential collaborator. He had recently returned home from Los Angeles, and right across the bay from Thomas, to Mobile, Alabama to build a recording studio and to develop young artists. Although they had been traveling in the same circles for 10 years they had yet to meet when their paths serendipitously crossed as Hirsch ended up stepping in as a last minute replacement for Thomas’ guitar player at a show in Mississippi. Immediately attracted to Thomas’s voice, songwriting and “all-around artistic soul”, the two artists began a creative partnership in 2015. Their allegiance and attraction to the Gulf cemented a creative bond and the two started to develop a sound that echoed the south. “It’s big, swampy and round, with each musician playing an integral role in bringing the songs to life”. One recurring theme in Thomas’ songs is connection, whether it be personal or one’s relationship to the ever changing physical and emotional environment. The Rare Birds are also intertwined musically and personally. Drummer John Milham first met Thomas when she relocated to Mobile to join his current band Slow Moses. In the 20 years since the move the two have revolved through each other’s lives, for a short time in Slow Moses, as brother and sister-in-law during Thomas’ marriage and eventual divorce from Milham’s brother, and finally with the first incarnation of The Rare Birds in 2014. Besides being part of the rhythmic tide behind The Rare Birds, John is the band’s “peacekeeper” and glue, keeping the band’s groove and spirit on course. It was also Milham who introduced bassist John Keuler to Thomas and later brought him into the band. Another local musician, bassist Keuler holds down the bottom end of The Rare Birds and contributes beautiful vocal harmonies behind Thomas. Keuler’s melodic bass lines and harmonic contributions are an integral part of the band’s lush sound which they have been sharpening on the road for the last four years. Enter Grammy award winning engineer Trina Shoemaker, best known for her work with Emmylou Harris, Daniel Lanois, Sheryl Crow, The Indigo Girls, Blues Traveler and The Dixie Chicks. Schumacher was working at Dauphin Studios in Mobile, where Honey’s Fury was recorded. She had heard the recordings and, after a chance encounter and discussion with Thomas at the supermarket, was enlisted to mix the record. Thomas wanted a lush, rolling, swampy sound, which was similar to Schumacher’s signature sound. In yet another serendipitous moment, Schumacher was added to Thomas’s team, mixing 11 of the 12 tracks on Honey’s Fury. Molly Thomas is an accomplished career artist with a strong point of view fronting a dynamic and experienced band of musical collaborators. Molly Thomas And The Rare Birds have a dedicated work ethic confirming their honesty and authenticity in every song, and have been hailed by both critics and their contemporaries as an integral and “unfiltered voice” representing the sound of the southern United States."

As an inventor of products that serve a gap in the marketplace, my products have been seen on The Today Show, The View, ET, The Marilyn Dennis Show, The Mom Show, endorsed by celebrity moms such as Courteney Cox and featured in numerous magazines and online sites such as Huffington Post, American Baby, Today's Parent & Parent's Magazine.

First, as a young teenager creating my own comics out of typing paper, colored pencils, and staples, and xeroxing them using the machine of a friend of my parents. Then as I graduated from high school, I had some near misses and minor publishing efforts in the 90's, under the Champion Comics banner and others. Then I took about a decade off to explore other life experiences. I got married and my now ex wife persuaded me to get back into publishing comics. The fruits of that rediscovery is American Revere. The character and storyline have been worked on for the past seven years. In that time, I've produced the American Revere Comic-Con Special #1, and Champion Comics Presents : American Revere #0. The next step in the American Revere mythology is this very issue that we are Kickstarter campaigning...American Revere #1. It's been a long and sometimes perilous journey, but we're finally nearing the end of the road, and the beginning of a new exciting road to the future. After this KS, we're going to prep not only Champion Age Anthology #1, but the follow up to this, American Revere #2. God bless, Carlos Raphael."

"561089665:::177365594:::Brought up in the coastal Northern Irish town of Kilkeel, I spent most of my time helping on the family farm, strumming my guitars, or playing about with wood and putting things together. At 16, I built a cajon drum out of scrap wood in my garage as I couldn’t afford one. I then began attracting interest in my custom cajons… Spotting an opportunity, I developed unique design concepts to deal with the problems addressed and after a successful Kickstarter Campaign in 2014, it wasn't long before my garage project turned into a full-fledged business: Ruach Music. Five years on - with a brand beginning to establish itself and a distinct catalogue now consisting of Guitars, Basses, Pedalboards, Effects Pedals, Cajons and Accessories - we exist to provide quality instruments for artists to enjoy, a platform for new music to be found and distinguished opportunity for emerging artists."

His Quartet Project, a six-volume collection which starts with simple pieces for beginning string quartets and gradually grows more complex, has been recorded by leading American ensembles like the Chiara, Jupiter, Parker, Miró, and Apple Hill quartets. Brooklyn Rider calls The Quartet Project, “a great idea at the right time,” and the Borromeo Quartet celebrates it as, “a wonderful resource… filled with vivid colors and characters.” Other commissions include The Bug Opera (2006), an opera for young audiences which was hailed as “clever and well-crafted, reminiscent of Bernstein or perhaps of a light-hearted avuncular Stravinsky”; Peal (2006), an orchestral work written in celebration of the 75th summer of Greenwood Music Camp; Meeting Ground (2003), a concerto for string quartet and orchestra, commissioned as part of the American Composers Forum’s Continental Harmony program and premiered by the Chiara String Quartet and the Greater Grand Forks Symphony Orchestra, and First Among Equals, a concerto for viola and chamber ensemble (2002), commissioned and premiered by violist Sam Bergman and the Oberlin Contemporary Ensemble.

"1067760101:::754158571:::My journey in photography started in 2009 during a deployment in Iraq and an old battered Nikon D1. Without any formal training, I was tasked with documenting interactions between U.S. service members and citizens of Iraq. I learned to overcome many different challenges on the fly and soon it became apparent to me that this photography stuff was so much more than just point and shoot. Through my learning of that brick of a camera, I became the permanent photog! https://www.dvidshub.net/news/96972/together-making-tracks-desert#.Vv6FkseEMbR After my service in the Army, I wanted to learn more. I enrolled at Salt Lake Community College and into their Visual Arts and Design Program. More avenues of the vast world of photography opened up for me there with the introduction of the history of photography, studio lighting and equipment, production, documentary, portraiture, and so on. Later, I was introduced to YouTube video creation and, being free from military obligation, I started to travel and explore using both still and video formats. I am a 'Digital Nomad' who explores street, lifestyle and portrait photographer/cinematographer."

Inspired by The Beatles, The Who, Yes, Black Sabbath, Rush, The Cars and The Police, he released his first solo album at the age of 13. “I played many instruments, wrote songs and recorded them,” says Zonana. “That’s really all that I cared about. I had to search hard for others that were equally passionate about making music. It was in my blood from the very beginning.”

Today Zonana owns a recording studio, Studio Z, in Nashville. He’s released twelve of his own albums and one live CD, in addition to working with and/or producing many other acts. Along the way he secured two major recording contracts and two major publishing deals, received strong US radio play for his songs “Holiday” and “Chasin’ It”, and toured the world several times with artists such as Ace Frehley, Adrian Belew, Crash Test Dummies and Lisa Loeb.

Zonana has recorded/mixed music for Adrian Belew, Crash Test Dummies, Blue Oyster Cult, Taylor Dayne, ATB and many others. He was in the first American band to ever play in Red Square, Moscow, in front of 70,000 fans. In May, 2007 he was featured on the cover of Guitar Magazine with Carlos Santana along with a full feature article. He’s contributed music to films and TV shows including Crazy Love, Men In Trees, Party Of Five, 24, Wonderful World, Dirt, Beautiful People, Army Wives, and Arrested Development.

Despite his many accomplishments, Zonana remains focused on the future. “Here’s the weird part…To me it feels like I haven’t really done anything yet. There’s so much more to do.”
Saul Zonana has been on tour solo, and as part of the adrian belew quartet for most of 2019. Check www.saulz.net for show dates."

"548467345:::1164899317:::Andy has been building miniature terrain since the 1980s. As a fan of D&D and tabletop role-playing games, he began to make tiles from styrofoam. This game terrain was very popular at Colorado Game Conventions, including Gator-Con, Ghengis-Con, and at Total Escape Games in Broomfield.

The modular dungeon idea started as a hand-made project, glued together from plaster bricks. These prototypes served their purpose well, and fueled several weekly games at Get Your Game On in Ann Arbor, MI. Andy crafts his largest rooms out of 80D rock-hard Resin, with graphite granules added. The result was a stunning realistic Granite rock effect. A flurry of expirimentation in color ensued. Then Andy tried different hardness ratings of resin, flexible plastics, meltable vinyl, as well as ""featherlight"" products.

Close friends began asking for commission projects. The Arena and the Wizard's Tower were born. How to keep those pieces together, and straight, was a conundrum. Enter the magnets...

After trying several ""lego-like"" themes, where pieces snap together through pegs and holes, Andy decided to abandon them all. They simply didn't look realistic with such obvious connectors, and there was no way to hide them. If only there was a way to get the pieces to connect and stay together, but in a way that is completely unseen. The answer: magnets. The magnets are placed INSIDE the molds, then the liquid rubber is poured in, surrounding and embedding the magnet permanently.

Andy is 44 and lives in Tecumseh, MI, just outside of Ann Arbor. He performed in Carnegie Hall at age 19, was a Professor of Music at Adrian College and Siena Heights University at age 22. He holds a BA in Electronic Music, a MA in Orchestraion, an MA in Classical Guitar Performance, and an Honorary Doctorate in Gospel Music. He and his cat Anakin Skywalker (it turns to the dark side) work on his castles in his basement.

Andy currently has terrain displayed at Get Your Game On in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as well as Acropolis Games in Adrian. DrakenStone: a ""drake"" is a wingless dragon. Gypsum ""stone"" was the first product available from Andy, featuring ""build-your-own"" kits using small blocks."

"1192407423:::976838733:::Gino is an Italian, London-based Director with a strong inclination towards Cinematography. He graduated in Italy in Discipline of the Visual Arts, Music and Performing Arts, 110 Cum Laude at the University of Salerno. During this time, he Writes and Directs 3 short films, as well as working on several independent feature films, documentaries and commercials. In 2014 he wrote and directed a documentary / interview with the award-winning Cinematographer Vittorio Storaro (whom he considers his mentor). This meeting drives him to find a place to carry on his studies that would allow him to merge his cultural baggage with a strong technical training. That is why after a long search around Europe and USA he attended the Master of Arts in Filmmaking at The London Film School, where he directed 2 short-films, worked as Cinematographer on 4 others and has taken part on several other projects with different roles, in and outside the school. Because of his craving for the visual storytelling, concept in which actions, camera, sound and design choices, talk louder than words, he strongly believes that a full engagement as well as a good communication among departments allows to reach the essence of the story rather than a mere picture aesthetic.

Si laurea in Disciplina delle Arti Visive, della Musica e dello Spettacolo con 110 e lode presso l’Università di Salerno.

Nel 2014 scrive e dirige un documentario/intervista al pluripremiato Direttore della Fotografia Vittorio Storaro (che egli considera suo mentore). Questo incontro lo spinge a continuare i suoi studi in un luogo che gli permetta di fondere il suo bagaglio culturale ad una forte preparazione tecnica. Per questo motivo, dopo una lunga ricerca in Europa e negli Stati Uniti, si iscrive al Master of Arts in Filmmaking alla London Film School, dove dirige 2 cortometraggi, cura la Direzione della Fotografia di altri 4 e partecipa a numerosi progetti con ruoli diversi, all’interno e al di fuori della scuola. Predilige il visual storytelling, concetto secondo il quale azioni, scelte nell’uso della camera, del suono e di scenografia, parlino più delle parole.

His work as both a versatile sideman, and experienced bandleader has JazzTimes calling him one of the “leaders of the young jazz piano scene.” From Narragansett, Rhode Island, Shore grew up listening to his father playing Bach on his home piano and would often sing along as a toddler. After starting piano lessons at a young age he began studies with famed educator Hal Crook as a teenager. Shortly thereafter Shore was awarded a full scholarship to Berklee College of Music. During his time there, under the mentorship of Danilo Perez, he performed in the Panama Jazz Festival, learning from Wayne Shorter, Brian Blade, John Patitucci while there. He moved to New York shortly after graduating, and had his first serious performing experience with acclaimed singer Gretchen Parlato- touring the US and internationally with her band, including the Stockholm Jazz Festival. Since then he has become one of the most in-demand pianists in New York, appearing as both leader and sideman at historic venues like Carnegie Hall, The Kennedy Center, Jazz at Lincoln Center, the Blue Note, and jazz festivals around the globe. He has had the opportunity to perform, tour and record with musicians such as Theo Bleckmann, Gretchen Parlato, Chico Pinheiro, Don Braden, Sara Gazarek, Ferenc Nemeth, Gilad Hekselman, Dayna Stephens, Noah Preminger, Ben Monder, John Hollenbeck, Mark Giuliana, Petros Klampanis among many others. As an educator Shore remains active in a variety of settings.

I've done a lot of digitally painted caricatures and traditionally painted movie posters over the past few years but my first love is comic books! Batman, Spider-Man, The X-Men, Superman...the list could go on! And now I've created my very own for the first time (as an adult)!

The seed for Riley and The Big Bear was planted way back in my childhood as I spent days watching movies like Indiana Jones, Star Wars, Back to The Future, Romancing the Stone, Goonies, Gremlins, E.T, Dark Crystal, The Neverending Story, Ghostbusters....etc. The list could go on but if you look at that list of movies then you can get a feel for what type of comic book I'm writing. It's going to fun. It's going to be fast paced with lot's of action, some comedy and a real sense of action and adventure. I'm throwing the kitchen sink and them. Don't worry. Riley and Big will get through it with style and grace. Well...maybe not so much grace.

The first issue is practically done, with only a few minor changes to make to the final product before I can send it to the printers. So I'm hoping you'll join Riley and Big on their adventures across their crazy and bizarre worlds. Let's see where this takes us!"

Things that last don't need to be replaced over and over again by things that end up in the landfill. In North America, we are taught the opposite. We are taught that we cannot afford quality. I'm living proof that you can. Fred grew up Mennonite. His family was not poor but Mennonites are frugal. They understand the value of a dollar and their ideology centres around service. While belongings are not idealized, they are cared for and respected as precious gifts. Money is not wasted and neither is time. In Mennonite culture, ""handmade"" is synonymous with recycled. Traditional quilts are made from the pretty scraps left on worn pyjamas; rag rugs are made from the sturdy strips of pants that can no longer be mended; and rugs are hooked from the wool bits of sweaters and socks that have seen better days. ""Something from Nothing"" is the song of our people. We hope you'll join us... at least for the chorus."

"1910832226:::1613817905:::Grilling has been popular since fire was discovered at the dawn of time. Since then grilling hasn't changed much, but where people grill is drastically different. From prehistorical times, man moved his grill from the cave, to the backyard, then to the park. Today, people grill on truck tailgates, pontoons, and house boats. Apartment dwellers and Millennials into the tiny house craze love to grill, but limited space makes it nearly impossible. We wanted to make the world a better place by reducing the amount of space it takes to grill, making grilling possible for everyone. We discovered there was no mounting bracket that unfolds, holds a grill, and is able to hang in a closet when not in use. After many prototypes, we perfected a 21st century revolutionary product designed for grilling--anywhere! Introducing Arnalls patent pending Grill Bracket @ “Anywheregrill.com”. Small, simple to use, and you can store it in a coat closet.
The grill industry already developed great designs of portable gas and electric grills, but most require a table which limits their use. Now you can hang a simple fold-able bracket over any railing, tighten the knobs to secure it, then fasten a portable gas or electric grill on it, and enjoy a hot delicious meal while spending time with friends or family we also provide a stand with or without a side table for use from your favorite lawn chair. Afterwards, hang it in your closet until the next get-together. Oh yeah, let's also comply with the majority of apartment lease agreements for no open flame grills by using portable electric grills.
I’m excited to bring this experience to your life, and I hope you’ll join us in revolutionizing how the world grills!

Mfouambila, which means “energy”, in the Lari language, is a folkloric Congolese Dance Company, whose goal is to continue to bring Traditional and Contemporary dance, music, theater, and seminars, to inspire and promote pride, respect, and self-confidence, within the African American Community, and to all who love African Dance. Congolese Dance and culture was introduced to New York City, by Titos Sompa, a native of Congo, Brazzaville, in 1972. We continue to share Congolese culture and show similarities between Central Africa, and American cultural heritage. Mfouambila Kongo is still committed through the expression of culture, songs, music, chants, call and response, and storytelling, to keep alive the rich culture of the various Congolese ethnic groups within the two Congo’s. Mfouambila Kongo is dedicated to continue with the exchange of instructors from abroad and throughout the United States, to introduce various dance styles that inspire dancers to create, move, dance, and to bolster pride within each dancer who values tradition and community.
Vision
Mfouambila Kongo seeks to enrich the lives of adults, children, and seniors through seminars, weekly dance classes, theater, and conferences, with the collaboration of guest teachers. This will be accomplished through structured performances, lectures, and with drum and dance workshops designed to involve and inform the community, of the beauty and diversity of Congolese culture. Mfouambila Kongo’s goal is to help everyone become healthier by movement, and to provide the Harlem community with weekly classes, and a yearly Dance and Drum Conference. We are proud to be the only African Dance Conference in Harlem, and the community looks forward to attending this yearly three day conference with teachers from Paris, Congo, California, and New York City. Mfouambila Kongo collaborates with various teachers with diverse styles that share information about their unique ethnic groups from the different regions of the Congo. This offers the students a broad view of the two Congo’s, with two different Presidents, Governments, and languages."

As a senior in high school, I had the opportunity to see a real children's book illustrator's studio, where I was able to chat, and even do a book making workshop with the artist. Once I realized that I wanted to be an illustrator, I attended the University at Buffalo and it opened the door to exploring digital media; expanding my traditional mediums pallette and learning various new design skills."

"1981214476:::1881637430:::I do call myself a feminist, all men should be feminists. If men care about women’s rights, the world will be a better place. We are better off when women are empowered — it leads to a better society. Women can be wives, mothers, comedians, bioengineers, hackers, auto mechanics… the pressure should not be on fitting stereotypes and norms, but instead, the pressure should be on launching yourself toward your true passions during the short time we have on this planet. Boys laugh at what they put girls through, but they won’t be laughing when they are wiping tears off their daughters face for the same reason.

We know that when women are empowered, they immeasurably improve the lives of everyone around them – their families, their communities, and their countries. This is not just about women, we men need to recognize the part we play too. Real men treat women with dignity and give them the respect they deserve. You can’t really find peace in the world when fifty percent of the world is excluded from the conversation. I think misogyny is like a disease that needs to be cured. And if we could eradicate polio, I don’t see why we eradicate misogyny.

For me as a feminist, it should be up to the woman to decide if she wants to be a mom if that's what she wants to do full time, that's awesome, that's what my mom did. But if she wants to go out and have a career apart from being a mom, then she should be able to do that as well, and that's to the benefit of everybody.

Let us use this century when we said we started the mission to end the violence and oppression of women."

Deduction Card Game, VERTIUM: Shadows of the Complex (SciFi), SHOOTERZ Hockey Card Game, STRIKERZ Soccer Card Game, WORDOPOLIS, and the author of Gold & Sharpe (a novella inspired by Get Adler!). I grew up in beautiful Cape Breton, Nova Scotia. Looking back on my childhood, I can remember inventing games.
At around 9 and 10 years of age, I used to sit down outside and show hockey cards to my beloved dog Spotty. I also made mini baseball games in the dirt with sticks and small pebbles. And best of all, I used to cut out those same hockey cards and play hockey at the kitchen table, with a silver ball for the puck: the foil from my mother's cigarette package.

Fast forward to the late 90's, I got an eye injury at work, which made me photophobic. I couldn't take bright lights and had to wear sunglasses all the time outside. I couldn't watch TV and I couldn't work on computers. The kids and I seemed to go back in time, and we spent many evenings reading, listening to the radio and playing games. Much to my surprise, I began to invent games again ...

I have had lots of help through the years, and I thank God for each person and each invention. I hope you will enjoy the games we bring here. Caper Games - bringing games to life! Enjoy! Randall"

NFL Football Veteran Quinn Remar Early, born in 1965 in New York,is a Hollywood Actor & Stuntman, Author, Film Producer and Alzheimer’s Advocate.He grew up in the theater where his mother, Dr. Ann Early, was a playwright. Early received an education in acting at a very young age. He always knew that he wanted a career in the performing arts and pursued that dream after retiring from his 12-year National Football League career as a star wide receiver.
In 2011, Early was inspired by his mother to get back into acting and stunt work.With all his talent, it was a natural transition for Early to move to working in Hollywood.He appeared in his first movie in 2012 and has been working in film ever since. He became part of SAG/AFTRA in 2014 and has appeared in over 30 films and television shows. On September 25, 2018 Early became the first human being to heli bungee out of a helicopter over the Grand Canyon in Arizona, first testing the heli jump in California forHollywood Actor Will Smith. (see link Will Smith's team for his Birthday Jump for charitywhich was streamed on Facebook and YouTube to an audience of millions.)
In 2008, Early’s mother was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s and he began to care for her. She asked Quinn to have her book “Bryant Acres” published, which he did in 2018 to honor his mother’s wishes. The book “Bryant Acres,” is about Early’s great grandfather seven generations removed, Sherrod Bryant. Bryant was a free man of color who at the height of slavery during the antebellum south, sold himself into indentured servitude. He fell in love and went on to become one of the wealthiest land owners of the time, and in the process, he built a multi-racial community.
Quinn began his writing career by publishing articles in Inside Kung Fu magazine. After the great success and debut of the book “Bryant Acres,” Early worked hard to develop the story into a screenplay based on his mother’s book. Early believes that everything that he's accomplished has prepared him for this. In his earlier years of success, he admits, “I’ve never been so passionate about anything. I always thought that it was about me, but I’ve come to the realization that all of my accomplishments were a vehicle for me to finish my mother’s dream and to help end Alzheimer’s, the disease that ultimately took my mother’s life.” In early 2019 Quinn wrote Just Bake Cookies and hopes to use it as a vehicle to raise money and awareness for Alzheimer’s research."

I remember a time where I thought my spirit was broken, and I stopped caring about everything in my life. It is no wonder that years later I chose teaching as a career and was drawn to children with behaviour disorders and special needs (especially autism). After several years of waiting for that innovated new child protection App to surface, my anticipation waned, and I decided not to waste any more time waiting (as abusers claimed the dignity and mental health of countless victims.) So, armed with my passion to make the world a safer place, I created Safety Aware. This App has become my passion, my hobby and my life goal. There is little out to address abuse, and nothing seems to have improved the statistics. I aim to make something good out of what happened to me. It seemed like a positive way to create a happy ending to a sad story I urge you to help me on my mission, because with child abuse statistics being so out of control, it’s likely that someone very special in your life has or is experiencing the same fate as I did. Please pledge and help the youth of today … and heal the adults of the future. Thank you for your generosity!"

We began operations in August of 2017 to serve as a local news source for Portland, Michigan, and neighboring communities. This independent hyperlocal online only news service was created largely in response to a lack of local news coverage that the community was getting from established print publications. We cover local news and events featuring the people, schools, non-profits and businesses that call Portland home.

Our network of paid and volunteer contributors writes content for the site on a part-time basis.

"22766821:::1747844412:::I wrote my short play Partner Of — last year, after grappling with the word “relationship” in a call for scripts on “the relationship between Thomas Jefferson and Sally Hemings.” Denise O’Neal, founder of Houston's Fade to Black Festival, generously consulted on my first draft. Since the three characters in this play are African American, and I am not, that seemed the only possible way to approach this project critically or appropriately. The ten-minute Partner Of — has had three staged readings across the United States: At Mainstage West in Sebastopol, CA, on the steps of the Historic Mordecai House in Raleigh, NC, as part of the MOJOAA Performance Group’s Reclamation and as a finalist in the 2018 Midwest Dramatists Center Conference in Kansas City. The play has been published by The Coachella Review. It has also been chosen for workshop, from among 150 scripts, by the Ivoryton Playhouse, in Ivoryton, CT, and will received full productions at Rover Dramawerks in Plano, TX, and Between Us Productions, in NYC, where it won Best Play. ""Partner Of—"" has been selected from more than 900 scripts, for inclusion in the 2019 Samuel French Off-Off Broadway Festival, August 19-24, in New York City. It is a tremendous honor to be invited as one of 3% of playwrights whose work will be shown. And among those 30 writers, the six finalists in the festival will have their work published by Samuel French. A stunning possibility. My background as a journalist is in historical research, and to engage with this narrative, I consulted with Niya Bates, Public Historian of Slavery and the African American Experience at Monticello, who offered her invaluably insightful dramaturgical guidance. ""Partner Of —"" serves to reframe the life of Sarah ""Sally"" Hemings, enslaved by Thomas Jefferson. Hemings bore six of Jefferson's children, while in captivity, her first pregnancy at just 14. Set in the confines of Hemings' windowless cell underneath Monticello, this play lifts three voices we've not heard from much, as Sally, her mother and grandmother confront their trauma, their fears and expectations, and imagine the possibilities of an illusory future.

"1680537640:::152401848:::Hello! My name is Jeff Cornelius. I have been a freelance artist for going on 25 years. My background includes time at Minneapolis. College of Art & Design and Art Institute Online-Univ. of Pittsburgh. Painting, drawing and generally being visually creative was always a primary part of my life and who I am.

Running art projects on Kickstarter for almost three years now has definitely provided motivation and inspiration. I am so grateful for all my backers and the support they have lent. The challenges presented have given me new directions and fresh ideas.

My last four projects; Ethereal Cats Greeting Cards, Flights of Creativity-Commissions, For the Love of Flowers - Commissions and Ballpoint Pen Tile Image Wildlife Calendar explored some new areas for me, providing additional avenues to follow. This current project, Choice of Subject Commissions Created by Jeff Cornelius, is meant to give my backers freedom to choose what I would create for them, maybe to make contact with some new backers to give me new challenges.

And please, if you have any thoughts on a project that you would like to see, let me know. It is my desire to connect as well as I can with those who appreciate and support my artwork.

Watercolor is something I've worked with since I was 5 years old and gives me options that I don't have with ballpoint pen, or even acrylic. The spontaneity and freshness is exciting to me since even I don't completely know what the end product will turn out to be, though I have a rough idea, I just trust my muse and paint.
Acrylics give a more solid, specific, controlled outcome and gives me the option of making any changes I need to make. It's not as spontaneous as watercolor, but can give a stronger end result.
Pastel for me combines characteristics of painting and drawing, giving me the control of drawing with the color and effects of painting. Oftentimes I am most comfortable with pastels. Around 15 years ago I began having trouble with my eyesight. The problem turned out to be cataracts and I had surgery to get lens implants, one eye at a time. The trouble came when my retina detached after each lens implant operation. This required retina surgery, more involved than lens implants. My sight in my right eye was almost lost and recovery from the retina surgery took vision away in that eye for over a month. My left eye wasn't as bad and recovery was easier. Then about 18 months later, the lens in my left eye slipped and another implant operation was needed. This time my retina held.This was quite a scare for an artist and since then I have tried to give more time to creating. I am thankful for any support I can get, and am energized so much by people who appreciate what I do. For the last 14 years, my vision has stayed at 20/30, 20/40 with no problems other than a reduced peripheral capacity and some blind spots due to the retina operations. I am so very thankful for the doctors and the technology that has made it possible for me to continue creating as a visual artist. Every new work is a real victory! Wildlife, landscape and animals are my main subjects of interest, but I also enjoy doing flowers, cars, and houses. Mediums I enjoy include,ballpoint pen, pencil, pastel, china marker, colored pencil, watercolor and acrylic, ballpoint pen being my most effective medium.

Your support will be much appreciated to help me expand my creative reach and show others what I am capable of."

Growing up Nick was an avid reader of comic books and could be found regularly buried in a copy of Warlord, Battle, Action, 2000AD, The Beano, Chipper or Rupert the Bear. Truthfully, you can still find him today with his feet up nose buried in a comic.

His writing career really began in the late 1990's while working for Games Workshop, he was given the opportunity to write for their Monthly Gaming Magazine White Dwarf; a job he tackled with gusto much to the horror of the Magazines Copy Editor. Nowadays he is still a content creator and writer, but is also a skilled web and graphic designer, sometimes artist, jack of all trades and a dedicated father.

He is married to a very patient Irish American Lady, and has three grown children.

Is a new visionary Film, series and content production company based in Mexico City and Tustin California. Whose main objective is to produce films, series and content in English for the fast growing global market. It is directed by producer/actor and cinema maverick Eduardo Arroyuelo and also Alejandro Diazayas Oliver and Armando Herrera (both respected names in the investment and corporate world in Mexico).

Pictures of you´s pipeline is filled with many stories with diverse themes and genres, different budgets at different stages of development. None of them passes the 5 million USD production budget. The films somehow are tangled together through the characters and/or story of each film. (Example: The minor character “Mentor” or “Agent of change” in one movie is the leading man of an other. It´s that character’s own movie viewed from his own and personal point of view. The protagonist of one might be the antagonist of the other. Etc. Stitching all the stories together create an interconnected universe among them becoming a series. All can easily be re-maked and easily re-written as TV series. Every movie is unique but they all are unified with a certain touch of magical realism. Using local stories with universal values, the scripts are designed to enter through a niche and organically find it’s way to global market expansion. It took ten years of developing the content. Writing and polishing the scripts through the supervision of prestigious american “script doctors."" ( Syd Field, Robert Flaxman, Skip Press, Writers store, etc.) Now ""Pictures of you” has in its pipeline the scripts and sources to produce the movies. ( And series spinoffs)

We are ready to cover a new demand where content is king.
The work has been done, The moment is now, the people are gathered…

The curriculum ranges from the fundamentals of music notation and rhythm to highly refined interpretation of challenging vocal repertoire.

I started life flawlessly mind and body. Just 8 years old left home alone with my 2 slightly older sisters my life changed forever. I just remember a sun shinny day ,silence, not even the wind made a sound as it swept the trees nor the cows behind the fence of our house made a move. Dad at work the last of his seven day work week mother Gripped by the hands of crack cocaine and later dead riddled with A.I.D.S . We where home alone. As kids we where never allowed to enter our parents room , old tradition that we respected , but this day the door was unlocked I entered in amazement like a distant world. My eyes big my mouth wide open damn near touching the floor! What was I to explore first? as the sun burst through open window shinning on a cigarette lighter on my parents dresser captivated me. With every cell in my body I ran with the object. All I remember next is running from the backyard my tiny 8 year old legs on fire burning away my army fatigued patterned pants flames are as tall as i was. That lighter forever burned in my brain and on my body .This Album is my musical medicine with every word shall heal my pain. These lyrics will bring me closer to understanding? but above all through my healing process Pray every soul that hears and reads my words shall find the ANSWERS.....WHY ME?"

"1849678648:::1779087235:::I'm a scouser born and bred, the daughter of a modern version rag and bone man, my mum, a creative herself that never pursued her creative dreams. I guess that's where it started for me, the product of parents that were one half creative and half entrepreneurial...after that its kinda the usual story, I went through school and thrived in the art block, struggled to find my place anywhere else - and my dream to start my own creative business was cemented.

I flexed my young business skills, selling baby portraits to kids parents for pocket money in junior school. Thanks to Kylie in the 80's (with her extra thick hairbands) I hit a home run in my all-girl-high-school, sewing and selling headbands to over 1000 girls!
I was always chasing creative opportunities - I even got offered work experience in the Steven Spielberg Amblimation Animation Studios when I was 17, after which I got offered a position in their Hollywood Studios! (now known as Dreamworks)
But I refused - I couldn't imagine being that far from family that young.

Whilst still studying for my graphic design degree in John Moores University I started my own company designing flyers for local businesses - which all changed after two years when asked to design the album artwork for local band The Coral. When The Coral got picked up by Sony Music things really started to escalate and I went on to design for The Zutons, The Dead 60s and Toploader amongst others. They were mainly local bands, so I decided it was time to branch out. Now a 4 strong team we went on to design for The Artic Monkeys, The Stands including the entire catalogue for local record label Deltasonic - even venturing into music videos.
During this time I had my first child - and I realised I wanted to work smarter and be at home for her - that, and my role in my company changing to predominantly managerial as opposed to creative, made me take the leap to close the studio and start up again as a freelancer - and get back to the creative stuff I love. After a year of hard slog and struggle as a single mum things really took off and I had a blast designing for many record labels, but mainly Island Records. My Client list included The Klaxsons, The Feeling, Nicki Minaj, Jessie J, I Blame Coco, The Wanted and Queen. I owe them a lot. Two kids later (3 altogether now) and having designed to briefs for years I downed computer and started drawing again, late at night, when the kids were in dreamland...these developed into my illustrated prints and greeting cards which I sell on my etsy website.

There's no way of knowing which pins will sell when you design them - and I can't afford to send a design to manufacture without knowing if it'll sell...Kickstarter enables me to gauge how popular a product can be through pre-ordering - and if it's successfully funded to my kickstarter project target, it covers the manufacturing fees, so I can carry on creating pressure free knowing I've at least broken even! xxx"

"847138676:::728879360:::Depuis toujours interpellée par l’art, l’artiste peintre Joanie Rémillard a commencé à peindre dès un jeune âge.

Originaire de Saint-Basile-le-Grand en Montérégie, Joanie représente humblement les nombreux talents d’ici et ce dit la nouvelle génération d'artiste. Son style est coloré, vivant, riche et abstrait.

Sous des abords de légèreté et de fluidité, l’œuvre de Joanie Rémillard communique l’inépuisable source d’énergie que sont les couleurs et les mouvements, lesquels fascinent et bouleversent. Joie, intrigue, euphorie et mélancolie font assurément partie des émotions provoquées par son art. La vision unique de Joanie rappelle que les émotions font partie intégrante de la vie et que le changement est inéluctable : tout se transforme.

Ainsi, en appliquant sur des tableaux de grand format, par couche, les différents matériaux (plâtre, peinture acrylique, pigments métalliques et résine d’époxy), Joanie crée des textures qui apportent profondeur et sensualité. Qu’elle soit abstraite ou intégrée en transparence, l’énergie se dévoile de façon expressive en plusieurs traits et jets de couleurs vives ou sombres. Une diversité des effets de lumière et des mouvements, à l’image de nos forces intérieures, voilà la réalité abstraite qu’elle nous propose.

“ J’ai toujours été passionnée par tout ce qui touchait l’art! J’ai commencé à peindre très jeune pour le plaisir et j’ai ensuite pris conscience qu’il y avait une place pour moi dans ce milieu. Je suis une jeune femme passionnée par l’art et particulièrement amoureuse de l’art l’abstrait. J’adore l’originalité et la créativité qu’il me permet d’explorer. Je débute mon travail de création à partir d’une harmonie de couleurs et mon imagination fait le reste, par et pour le plaisir! Mes toiles sont des œuvres uniques et remplies d’énergie. Je crée pour vous des tableaux abstraits modernes et rempli d'énergie. Je vous offre donc mes services pour vous aider à concevoir votre décor avec des toiles modernes ayant un design à l’effet garanti. Si vous êtes intéressés par un tableau créé sur mesure, avec des couleurs spécifiques et une dimension particulière, n’hésitez pas à me contacter et il me fera plaisir de transposer votre imagination en projet artistique.”

Description du style: Une couleur seule n'est qu'une couleur. Ce n'est que mise à côté d'une autre qu'elle dévoile sa singularité. Elle peut alors bouger, se mouvoir, danser, exploser! Mon premier style est né de l'envie d'utiliser le mouvement pour marier les couleurs. Inspirée par les couleurs qui m'attirent, ou par celles qui m’inspirent, je laisse ma créativité guider mes mouvements afin d'animer les couleurs. Celles-ci ne doivent pas que cohabiter, elles doivent se recouper, se superposer, s'enlacer pour créer un mélange qui est en fait, une parfaite harmonie."

Before going into business for herself, Collette had tried for years to find a paying job and experienced constant rejection and heartbreak. Collettey's Inc was borne out of her first-hand understanding of the challenges that the disability community faces in trying to enter the workforce, and her desire to help others with different abilities find career success. She understands too well what not “a good fit” means.
Collette has created a global movement (check out https://www.colletteys.com/in-the-news/) has been written up in 16 countries and received 13 awards across the United States to date. She speaks to audiences of hundreds to thousands and has decided she needs to use her platform to create change and to help the non-disabled population see abilities and start including and employing people with disabilities more and more. It pains Collette to know 82% of people with a disability, that are capable of work, cannot find paying jobs…which means they cannot live independently.
Collette is writing a series of books that she hopes will encourage inclusion and blended societies for people with disabilities. She also wants to help families through some of the harder struggles she feels she conquered."

"1044930636:::997864167:::My Father was an artist and art has always held an important place in my life. As a high school student it was suggested to my parents, by my art teachers that I follow a career in that field and go to the Beaux-Arts in Paris. Being 18 at the time, and all knowledgeable, I did the next best thing. I met an American, fell in love, got married came to the States, had three children, and life took over.
Now that the children are gone and at the urging of my husband, I finally have the opportunity to get back to do something that I enjoy.
Another factor that prompted me to give time to this pursuit was a health issue. A few years ago I was diagnosed with A-Fib, Atrial Fibrillation. For three years, I was plagued with this illness rather severely and was about to have a surgical procedure to correct the condition. Just at that time it began to subside. Since then the problem has not reoccurred and I feel very fortunate. During the time of this illness, I came to realize I was not immortal after all and maybe it was time to do something more creative and enjoyable. Thank you for your attention to my project, I do appreciate all support I get.

May’s songwriting reveals her innate ability to emotionally engage with her audience through her lyrics. She shows us her heartbreak, but she also shows us her empowered and emboldened spirit. In her quest to find her most authentic self, May gifts each listener with a powerful, emotional experience that immediately connects her to us.

Raised in a home full of art and music, Erlewine began writing songs at a very young age. As a teenager she hitchhiked across the country, honing her skills as a performer and absorbing the kind of stories and landscapes that would inform her music. She came to know the land and the pulse of the people. Her songs show a very real connection and concern with everyday folk. In the following years, Erlewine would perform in every kind of venue imaginable, from street corners to festival stages to the live-FM airwaves of A Prairie Home Companion.

Erlewine draws from a wide variety of influences to create her sound. Lyrically, her songs are rooted in hard-wrought wisdom, joy and sorrow, simplicity, and stories from her own everyday experiences. Musically, these messages are wrapped up in traditional folk roots, Americana, old-time country swing, soul, and even rock n’ roll. As a live performer, she is just as magnetic when fronting a seven-piece dance-party funk band as she is playing solo acoustic songs in a living room house concert.

With a long list of full length albums, two EPs, and numerous collaborations, Erlewine’s catalog is proof of her creative power. Her work has been spotlighted by Rolling Stone and NBC’s The Voice. National acts who have covered her songs include Greensky Bluegrass, Railroad Earth, Sawyer Fredericks (Season 8 winner of The Voice), Joshua Davis (Season 8 finalist of The Voice), Lindsay Lou and the Flatbellys and others.

Erlewine uses her music as a platform for positive change. She considers her job a service-oriented one and carries the torch of the folk singer activist. Her voice on stage encourages connectedness and stresses the importance of environmental advocacy, social justice, creative empowerment and community building as necessary work in the world. May is an anthem and another incredible example of why we need to start listening to women,
we need to hear these stories.

May’s music has touched people all over the world. Her words have held solace for weary hearts, offered a light in the darkness, and held a lot of space for the pain and joy of being alive in these times. When she starts to sing, there’s no way around it. Welcome to the moment, everyone."

I am a young father and caring eternal companion to a lovely family, Epiphany Yates and our babies Astreyah and Prince. Long ago I ended up marooned on ""Earth."" Since being here I have had to adopt an earthly, human identity known as Cody Lestelle, a rather daring and dream prone sort. Cody is in a doctorate program through the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa specializing in Alternative Futures and Indigenous Politics, a Master of Education program in Learning Design and Technology, and Virtual Reality Gaming Learning fellow with GCAS Research Institute Ireland. Cody is also the founder and director of the Academy for Gameful & Immersive Learning Experiences. Cody's dissertation involves the cultivation of play based autonomous learning pathways and platforms capable of moving beyond the deep limitations of modern education. Cody also has a combined total of nine years of experience teaching in higher education and all levels of K12 plus eight years teaching and learning in self-organized and non-institutional settings.

The primary problem Cody aim's to resolve with this project is the tension inherent in modern education, namely that children are being prepared for a future that will not exist if we fail to make drastic and immediate changes to the organization of human capabilities and societies. The conditions of life and the potential for humans to ethically live ""the good life"" has been a long enduring concern for Cody which has only intensified with the recent transformation to Fatherhood. The youth are too often being lied to and as parents and teachers we are complicit in their suffering and generally in the Sixth Great Extinction unless we lead and teach by example and act in harmony with life of/on Earth."

"2084172826:::893604581:::I was born in Habana Cuba and migrated to Spain at the age of 5. When we arrived in the United States, I was overwhelmed at the enormous size of the skyscrapers and cars in New York City. As a child I loved to travel into Manhattan with my grandfather to purchase fabrics for his custom tailor business, all the while hoping to catch a glimpse of Spiderman swinging between the skyscrapers.

Being the first in my family with a serious interest in art, I have to credit my High School art teacher, Thomas Carcich with giving me my foundation in art and being instrumental in guiding me to study art in college. After receiving a BFA from New Jersey City University in 1988, I worked in several small business to business advertising agencies in New Jersey as an artist before marrying and moving to Orlando Florida to start a family with my wife in 1992.

I returned to my first true art-love, oil painting, in 2012 after an unintentional hiatus of well over 20 years. Wanting to give my mother a more unique Birthday present than in recent years, I decided to do a small oil painting for her. While delighted at how much I enjoyed the process, I was more than a little dismayed at how much I had forgotten about painting! Although Mom loved the painting, I immediately set out to bring my skill with oils up to where I wanted them to be. I know I can never reach my ever advancing and evolving goal, but I strive to make progress with every painting. I’ve repurposed and refurbished my home studio to paint from life. That’s where I can always be found trying to make up for lost 20 years. I have been fortunate to win recognition in local and regional art shows and am starting to enjoy recognition at the National level. I still live and paint in Orlando with my wonderfully supportive family, and three very mischievous cats."

Over the years I have sold many pieces of work on an ad hoc basis and feel confident the time is now right to give Art my full time attention.

"1049487376:::376070413:::Loza Rose, born Sophia Jackeline Zuniga, is an American singer, songwriter, and former YouTuber.

Born in 2000, in Teaneck, NJ, Loza Rose started singing and playing piano at the early age of seven. She took piano lessons for two years before performing in theatre both as a singer and a young actress. This continued until her Freshmen year of high school, where she changed her interest to choir full time. In 2014, she took to YouTube where she sang covers and spoke about mental illness. During her Junior Year, one of her videos reached 200k views within a month. This inspired her to begin composing her own music, and she did starting in 2015 writing over 30 songs that year. Right out of high school, Loza decided to push her musical talents to the next level. Taking independent vocal lessons and hiring a manager to push her career forward, she was signed to EAR after six months of developing her sound.

Loza gives credit for her lyric style and musical composition to her idols. Her grandmother, Elsa Maria Loza (known as a singer and an accomplished performer in Quito, Ecuador) inspired Sophia to appreciate music in all forms. It wasn't until that close family member fell ill, Sophia’s drive to achieve a career in the music industry began. After pursuing a life of performing at small events, Sophia created Loza Rose as her stage name to remember and honor her grandmother, Elsa. Some of her other idols for songwriting and performance can be attributed to Demi Lovato, Christina Aguilera, Kesha, Whitney Houston, and Selena. Loza Rose describes her music as “unique and inspirational” while her sound can be found in Indie Pop. Her range in music however, does not stop at just that, but also can be heard in Electronic and Latin Pop. She hopes to one day hear her music on local radio stations, Spanish clubs and perform at benefit concerts. On November 17th, 2016, Loza Rose sought treatment at a mental hospital for self-harm. After 11 years of hurting her own body, she finally decided that it “wasn’t normal”, and was convinced by her school therapist. She was diagnosed with Obsessive Compulsive Personality Disorder, and she has been on medication since the day she was admitted to cope with her ongoing-condition. As a musician she finds that song writing is her way of escaping her difficult past. Loza sometimes hopes that her music will help those who don't have the sense of family or have a strong tether to the world, and give people the inspiration to liberate themselves. Loza adds; “I want to give back to the world that same feeling that musicians give me when I listen to their music. That sense of empowerment and emotional conflict you hear is just beautiful”."

MM continues to provide facilities and grant services to its 1st school, which opened its doors in 2001.

For over 12 years, MM also raised and managed funds for its sailing canoe program, Kanehunamoku Voyaging Academy. KVA grew substantially in its scope and outreach, and now has its own nonprofit.

All throughout, MM ran an entirely volunteer-driven 'Maoli Music' program. In 2013, thanks to a decade of fundraising and a federal grant, this evolved to become the Mana Mele Project, which features:

* a 4-in-1 solar powered mobile studio - live event and studio services, both audio & video

* a Music/Multimedia Academy - over 160 lessons aligned with math, science, L.A., social studies standards and Hawaiian language and culture, taught through music, engineering and video production

* the Mana Maoli Collective - over 200 musicians, engineers and videographers giving their time and talent to bring Mana Meleʻs mobile studio and curriculum to life.

Mana Mele will document the legacies of our elders, empower our youth, and make history - moving forward.

Brought to you by MELE (a university program), Mana Maoli and 14 partner schools (primarily Hawaiian charter and immersion), Mana Mele was our response to a clear void in our community. We believe this can be duplicated successfully worldwide. Come learn, grow and serve with us - help create music, movies, and leaders of tomorrow."

My life has always involved gaming since I can remember - my first computer was a Sinclair ZX Spectrum which Santa brought to me one Christmas Eve back in the 80's. Since that snow laden festive time I have had an affiliation with most consoles and computers released in the UK since and fondly remember the other distractions of the time - the toys, the adverts, the American TV shows, the sweets to name but a few.

Even though appreciating the art of current games and the sparkly new consoles they are played on, I fondly recall the older systems and titles I have played over the years. As I get older, there is more history to look back on

A good few years ago, when there were a few less grey hairs, I organised a retro gaming event for charity - this involved taking over a large cricket club venue down the road from where I live and filling it with arcade machines, pinball tables and every console and computer I could get my hands on. I announced the event, sold some tickets and hoped people would turn up on the day which they thankfully did. As a momento, I produced a 28 page magazine I called Retro Fusion and gave it to those who came along. This very act started my interest in magazine publishing both in the print and online world.

Issue 1 and 2 of Retro Fusion was distributed in the Gamestation chain of stores in the UK - somewhat a coup at the time. Issue 3 was always planned, but unfortunately due to a number of conflicting events in my life at that time, never materialised - this was 6 years ago.

So as well as now being a little older, the Playstation 2 in some circles is now also deemed retro!

Issue 3 and 4 now exists - thus onto my next project."

"2073090877:::1475524938:::“Billy Harvey is better than everybody else."" - The king of Austin music, Bob Schneider

If you ever happened to be in earshot of Bob some years ago, there's a pretty good chance you heard him say something to this effect. Billy was playing lead guitar in Bob's band at the time. He was also the guy prone to wearing a large pair of retro headphones on stage. In the back of Schneider's tour bus circa 2003, Billy Harvey could often be found working on songs that would eventually end up comprising his cult classic, Pie. All these years later, Pie will finally be released on vinyl. Astonishingly, it’s the first of Billy Harvey’s studio recordings to have made it to this medium.
With a pile of D.I.Y. releases that date back to the early 2000s, a voice that is emotionally riveting and unmistakably his own, a guitar style that is equal parts melody-central and atmospheric wizardry, and a back catalogue chock-full of enduring songs, Billy Harvey has been inexplicably flying under the pop culture radar for nearly two decades. Yet, in certain musician circles coast to coast, he has often been cited as one of the best-kept secrets in the business. He's worked with scores of artists as producer and sideman (including Patty Griffin, Charlie Mars, Rhett Miller, the aforementioned Schneider, and Steve Poltz), done some acting, written a kick-ass poetry book, won the John Lennon International Songwriting Contest, and even made a documentary film while he toured in an old Mercedes Benz rigged to run on vegetable oil. So, congratulations to you if this is the first time you’ve ever heard of Billy Harvey or his music.
Billy was born in Evanston, Illinois in 1967, but eventually landed in Austin, Texas. (If you think his music bears more than a passing resemblance to Jeff Tweedy’s, please consider that the Wilco frontman is 8 months Billy Harvey’s junior and that they hail from the same part of the country. Maybe there was something other than lead in the ‘67 Illinois drinking water?) Harvey relocated to California as a teen and played in bands there before moving to Texas in the late ’90s. The first 6 of Billy’s 9 full-length releases were done in a little house he owned off North Burnett in Austin. Pie was the 2nd of these and originally came out in 2004. His close friend and Austin music legend, George Reiff, would occasionally come over and add some bass. Other than Reiff, though, what you mainly hear on Pie is the work of a one-man band: the band of Harvey!
Pie kicks off with “Stupid Daniel,” an endearing pop tale with an insidiously catchy melody. Its unlikely protagonist might not technically be as smart as the rest of the kids, but “he knows more than everyone.” Stupid Daniel is a misfit and, just like the Kinks and the Replacements, the misfit is Billy’s lead character of choice. In “Like A Boy,” Billy casts himself in the role: “I hate it when your father treats me like a boy.” How’s our hero supposed to keep the girl he loves when her father thinks he’s a no-good loser? The song bobs along over Reiff’s moving bass line, and the listener is swept away by a wordless melody that feels less like defeat and more like a celebration. Billy Harvey is clearly having fun on this record. From the rapid-fire rhymes found in the Beastie Boys-esque “Dope Wings” to the could-be-arena-rock pop of “Invisible,” Pie is an effortless exercise in perfect pop hooks that would’ve been lauded and snatched up in droves if greater-known acts like Beck or Wilco had created them.
It’s fitting that this timeless record came from an underground, D.I.Y. underdog misfit. It’s even more fitting that Pie finally makes it to vinyl 16 years after it was recorded. A musician only motivated by marketplace successes would’ve thrown in the towel long before this release ever saw the light of day—but not Billy Harvey, who is still going strong writing and recording new music in his latest home, Nashville."

My work is often fragmented, showing fighters and victims, survivors and the suffering, tormentors and refugees, as they intersect and diverge. I am interested in the spaces of war and the people in them."

Why not indeed, and from that moment the plan for Why Not Games emerged. We are a collective of writers, illustrators, marketers, and more who just want to make games. Well, that and sell them to you. Also, play some games. Lots of games.

We have a simple policy:
Games should be fun. Yet, games are more than simply entertainment. Playing games helps to build cognitive skills, especially critical thinking. You can also learn much about history, science, philosophy, and the entire spectacular universe we live in by playing games.

Any creative work, and this includes writing and drawing for games, has a message, a purpose beyond merely being fun or looking good. Ours certainly do, and we hope to spread liberty, equality, and fraternity with our games, and have fun while Ken Spencer, Co-owner

ENnie award winning creator of Rocket Age, Ken is our creative director and lead writer. He has written for Cubicle 7 Entertainment, Chaosium, Frog God Games, Alephtar Games, and Steve Jackson Games.

"1435081246:::819636007:::Who we are?

Every journey starts with some small steps, so does ours too. Our journey of establishing this small developer firm started back in 2017. Moving toward to a goal where creating best entertaining mobile game experience in a way that will make us aside from others. Initially with the steps of two cornerstone founders, back in 2017, mini pack started its journey. They were friends from the very beginning of the college life. They both had a common interest about mobile gaming. Their dream was creating mobile games that will aid as a future potential of mobile gaming industry. After completing graduation, they pursued their dream together but luck was not on their side. After searching for jobs that will suit their purposes, there were no ways. On the other side of the coin, reality of life came to show up with a need for money to take care of the family. They were shuttled back and forth between their dream and reality of life. Still they didn’t give up and started their own firm. Whatever happened they have gone together through the situation and gathered small bulk amount money by doing tuition and part time sales job. Only with this small amount of source they started their first step. Poor financial condition was crumbling all the hope but still with no external assistance such as financial or technical assistance they have been working hard all day/night in a rented room to pursue our dream. Going through all odds, even their families didn’t support them because they couldn’t provide any aid to the family in the meantime. There were times where there was hunger but no money to buy, there were no electricity for due bill, there were no communication to the closed ones and still having great patience and they have ignored all the obstacles and stayed determined of what they have forwarded for. When someone starts something in which they are passionate, always there will be some people to discourage such hardworking people. Regardless of all obstacles the crafty hands of only two persons of mini pack produces its first production “Dragon Paradise City” mobile game. It was launched for both android & iOS platforms. Afterwards, the next project came up with an idea of making idle/incremental game. Hence, idle/incremental is a popular genre that’s why mini pack wanted to focus on building idle game. From there the idea “Tap Stars” was born & still developing. In the meantime, there are four devoted new members were included in the mini pack family to enhance the development process and creating quality output. So, this firm has become a source of livelihood for the people who are working in. Still there is no external assistance but here we are. As the family evolved a little bit, the need for finance has grown too. We believe that if our passion is true, anything is possible, but sometimes there are some financial bottlenecks, which slow down our progress toward our motto. We will be much grateful if any helping hand cordially helps us to retain the future of the firm as well as the keeping the dream alive. Still regardless of all problematic issues we never stopped.

We the Mini Pack Family will never stop dreaming until we turn our dreams into reality."

Mein beruflicher Werdegang führte mich in die IT und ich lernte viele wichtige Fähigkeiten die ich auch für die Sammlung nutzen konnte. Bereits 2013 entschloss ich mich, meine Sammlung auf das Super Nintendo zu fokussieren. Schnell lernte ich das es viele falsche Informationen und fehlendes Wissen zu dem Thema gab und nahm es mir zur Aufgabe einen korrekten Guide zu verfassen, der sämtliche Titel für das SNES umfasst. Mein nächstes Ziel war es danach, für jeden SNES-Titel ein custom Coverart zu erzeugen um eine einheitliche Sammlung zu ermöglichen. Dies wurde leider dadurch verhindert, das keine Hüllen dauerhaft verfügbar waren. Schlussendlich entschied ich daher selbst Hüllen zu entwerfen und herstellen zu lassen."

I love to move.
I love to be moved. I love to move people.

From a young age I felt an external pressure to fit into a mould that wasn't me. Because of this pressure I experienced immense amounts of uncontrollable emotions of stress, anxiety, fear anger and resentment that caused me to feel separation from society. I felt uneasy and disconnected in my body and mind.

These feelings pushed me into a life on the road to discover alternative movement practices, medicines and therapies. Through these therapies I learnt to manage my stress and anxiety. And now that I have been through the journey I want to share my discoveries and help others who feel the same.

In today's society stress, anxiety and lack of sleep are a major cause of health problems I teach natural movement practices for people to discover comfortability in their own bodies. These simple yet effective practices help people feel relaxed and calm in any situation.

I know that movement heals. I know it has the power to develop focus and awareness, release tension whilst opening the mind and body into a calming space."

Arthur Sadowsky & the Troubadours perform a modern vision of classic jazz that is stimulating to the jazz enthusiast while at the same time very melodically pleasing to the casual music lover. Born and raised in the icy tundras of the USSR Arthur was surrounded by music and art from a very young age and knew this was going to be a life-long passion. Studying Russian classical music throughout his childhood it wasn’t until the age of 14 when he heard the music of Joe Zawinul that his life would change forever. Hearing jazz for the first time was the awakening he was looking for, according to Arthur “it was like being able to fly or speak to Dolphins.” He knew to pursue this dream he would have to leave his country. Arthur’s love affair with the bass guitar started when he was 16, he recalls “I was at a night club checking out a musician-friend of mine and the band was on break, standing alone in the middle of the stage was this sleek and sexy electric bass gently supported on a guitar stand by its neck. I was in love for the first time in my life and this passion will never wane.”

Through years of study, Arthur has perfected his craft as a performer, composer, and arranger and has truly created his own unique sound with heavy influences from the great lineage of jazz musicians most notably Duke Ellington, Thelonious Monk, and Joe Zawinul. “I can’t wait to see what is next for me on this artistic journey through life. I am looking forward to sharing my deep and passionate love of music with all of you, please stay tuned and never stop swinging.”"

We are the German 3D food printing startup Print2Taste located in Freising, close to Munich, Bavaria. Almost 5 years ago, our team of food experts, hardware and software enthusiasts and experienced founders joined forces to conquer the world of 3D Food Printing. 9 months later, we successfully launched our first Kickstarter campaign in June 2015 with the world's first Plug & Play 3D food printing system. As promised to our backers, the first devices had been delivered in time before Christmas same year. With the 3D food printing system Procusini® we are worldwide targeting the professional market in hotel, catering, event gastronomy and confectionary since 2016.

At that time, we had already been fascinated by the idea of building a Choco 3D Printer for every kitchen. After 3 years of development, the time had come - the first mycusini® had been producing Choco objects in an impressive quality. The first feedback of enthusiastic users helped us to further optimise the whole system. Eva, ""Mom of mycusini®"", summed up our feelings in the following statement:

„With our many years of experience in the professional field of 3D food printing, we want to make the benefits of this amazing technology available to everybody. That’s why we developed mycusini®. With mycusini®, consumers will get access to the creative world of 3D Choco printing at a very attractive price“.

As in many families, everyone in the mycusini®-team demonstrates a different know-how and character. In the many years of more than friendly collaboration, a team was formed that mastered even incredible challenges.

"1431389946:::1108413712:::The things that influenced me to pursue Music Production is the sounds, the lyrics, and the producing behind the music. It started back in 2009 in Atlanta, GA; the more I got interested in music, the more I started to develop a passion for music. As the years went by; I started to get familiar with artist from all walks of life and producers who produced their music from all walks of life. I started getting interested in wanting to know how music was made, what was the producers using to make music, and what was their strategy to make the artist music sound the way it sound. Later on I discovered that a lot of producers who`s music I was studying, used a computer to produce music. I knew the producers used a computer to make music, I still did not know how they made the music with the computer. I later found out through a friend; who was after the something’s I was after, told me about a program call FL Studio that made music. After finding that out I saved up some money to buy a laptop and quickly searched on the Internet for that program. Not only did I find out about FL Studiobut I also found out there where more programs that does the samething as FL studio, even better. So I look into those programs also and soon discovered they were expensive. Buying a program at that time was not an option due to the lack of finances. So I found out FL Studio had demo version that was free to download and it was on from there. Once I started to play with FL Studio, it was there where I wanted to know how to design my own sounds and how to create every genre of music that was out there. Having an ambition to be the best in music changed the way I looked at everything in life, music is everywhere I thought to myself from time to time. Music is in movies, video games, and cellphone ringtones. Right then and there is where my goal was set in place to be one of the best in producing music, designing sounds, and writing lyrics. From FL Studio on the PC, I slowly merge to Garageband on the Mac. When I first started playing with Garageband I thought it was very confusing, being that I just came from a completely different platform on how to make music. But as the months went on; I started to get more comfortable with the Garageband, that program that changed my whole perspective on music. I later found out these are not programs, these so called programs are DAW`s, a (Digital Audio Workstation). From Garageband I discovered another DAW that was better and similar to Garageband called Logic Pro X.Now Logic Pro X to me in my opinion has to be the first DAW in history that has its own self-sufficient plugins that is state of the art. Not only plugins, but it also has to be the only DAW that has everything you need to be a producer, sound designer, film composer, and recording artist. I probably spent over six long years with Logic Pro X, but it wasn’t a DAW that can easy be mastered. From there I went to Pro Tools; music production has become a life style more than a career for me and I look forward to many more years in music production."

Originally the plan was for me, as a concert pianist, to perform ""Rhapsody in Blue"" while several actors and dancers performed routines during my performance. In order to do this, I decided I needed to know more about this incredible piece of music and began my inquisitive and artistic search for information. Well, as they say, that was like 'opening a can of worms' for me! What began with me buying one biographical book on George Gershwin and reading the chapter entitled ""Rhapsody in Blue"", quickly grew into a seven year research period that involved me reading over twenty two books and dedicating thousands of hours to internet research and story development, as I decided that the incredible story behind this world-class masterpiece was worthy of much more than the 20 minutes it takes to perform. In fact, this was not just a piece of music. This was history in the making. Gershwin’s composition changed the face of classical music as we know it. This was a story that HAD to be told. An incredible story that would need at least two hours! And so was born RHAPSODY IN BLUE… The Stage Musical! Since 2012, I have been devoting my days (and nights) to researching, writing and developing RHAPSODY IN BLUE … The Stage Musical! My goal is for the musical to be playing On Broadway and in The West End by February 12, 2024 - the 100th anniversary of the world premiere of George Gershwin’s masterpiece ""Rhapsody in Blue""."

"1536710769:::1659425929:::Hi, everyone, My name is Himal Kamdar. I was born and raised in India. My parents are entrepreneurs and had 3 handbags shops in my home town Ahmedabad, India. Since my childhood, I have been going with them and watching them designing and selling handbags and started felling in love with handbags and entrepreneurship. I finished my graduation in 2010 from India and moved to USA in the same year. After moving, I pursued my MS degree in product development from Stevens Institute of Technology, NJ. Currently, I have been running my Vegan company ""Sybaritic bags"" in 2 retail locations in Bear,DE and in Deptford, NJ. I live in Newark, DE with my husband Gunjan, my beautiful daughter Aaria and my handsome dog Bruno.

From the very first day, we both have been thinking to bring something innovative for all consumers. We were always in search of something that could simultaneously help the community or at least bring awareness to the society (either for humans or animals.) For example, after we opened the company, we immediately contacted ""PETA"" organization and learned about various materials in which the animals do not get harmed. Furthermore, We started bringing very high quality handbags made from PU, Nylon and canvas from our manufactures. Our idea was to change the concept that animals don't need to get harmed or killed in order to wear fashionable bags. Non-leather bags are equally durable and look elegant at the same time. We both are animal lovers, and have an amazing Labrador Retriever ""Bruno"" and are absolutely satisfied taking the first step against animal cruelty. At last, we both would like to thank you all for spending your valuable time to read about our project and supporting it."

"1560947324:::387219938:::Throughout my childhood I was encouraged to appreciate and actively engage in drawing, colouring and painting, with my family and these were activities that gradually developed, and I became more confident, creative and expressive in my work. It was at school where I was awarded an art scholarship and my love for expressing myself and the world through my artwork just continued to flourish from there.
Prior to commencing my undergraduate course in Illustration and Graphics at Coventry University (2017), I decided to complete a BTec National Diploma in Graphic Design, this I felt laid down a good foundation to develop further my knowledge and skills in relation to art and graphic design. Furthermore, it was during my final year at college that one of my typographic art work pieces, was selected by a joint selection panel to be exhibited in the Herbert Art Gallery Coventry. This fuelled both my confidence and motivation to further my knowledge and skills in graphic design and art. I have found that I have developed quite an eclectic style with a growing interest in photography, but I very much enjoy blending traditional arts and crafts including photography, linocut, painting, oil pastels and calligraphy. These are the mediums and techniques which I will continue to work with in the future.
I have always found that sharing my artwork with people and making a difference to them was something that brought me much joy and to be able to do that through something that I have a strong passion for just made it that much better. I understand the therapeutic benefits of art and art therapy and the way in which it can communicate with people and the healing which this can bring to individuals who are particularly traumatised. Nature and the environment are both very important to me and inspire much of my activities in my own time.
During my first year at Coventry University I undertook a Global Experience field trip whereby I arranged a visit to Trinity College Dublin and met the head of conservation who arranged a personal tour of the or the Long Room of the Old Library and a talk relating to the ‘Book of Kells’. It was amazing to see such ancient artefacts and appreciate the graphics and the culture reflected in these historic documents. During 2019 my second Global experience field trip took me to Cabo Roig Spain whereby I came to appreciate another culture and how this is reflected in art and design.
Looking to the future I look to complete my undergraduate studies and consider further studies at Master’s level. Deep down I have real empathy for people and would like to think that my work not only inspires people but can also have a therapeutic healing affect when necessary. But I also hope that within the next decade I would be known within the world of graphics and art and clients who readily commission and recommend my work to others."

Just by looking at my parents reaction on it i knew it's something very special in this world. I start paying more attention to music, and soon chose my own styles. My Mom often played french orchestra Paul Mauriat and french instrumental band Space. ABBA,Maywood, Beatles, Italian Ricci 'n Poveri, Space, those was one of my very first vinyl exploring. Then Modern Talking, I think nothing influenced me more on my life, not just in music styles, but life overall is Modern Talking band, German duo with dance synth euro-pop styles. I was so influenced by it, that at age 10 i signed my self up to the piano class at the local music studio. My writing started then as well, constant humming of different tunes that i thought it would be nice to perform. I wanted sound like Modern talking, look and be Modern Talking.
Through the years I've learned great other artists to my self like Michael Jackson or Madonna, Metallica and Roxette. Though my styles became not ""modern talking necessarily"", but influenced enough to have them in mind and compare some of my sounds.
My Music styles are mostly electronic ambient, and hi-nrg. Also up-lift.

"632407800:::1520559053:::Trade Winds Ensemble is a group of six musicians who, in their own lives, prioritize excellence in music performance, educating youth, and responding to the social injustices we see in the world. TWE members are Jonathan Hannau, Suzanne Hannau, Ellen Hindson, Brandon Rumsey, Midori Samson, and Jamie Sanborn.

In 2013, we united to form TWE as a way to combine these three aspects of our musicianship. Our pilot residency took us to Nairobi, Kenya, where we partnered with several music institutions in the city and taught beginning music classes at the Rise and Shine Academy. We hosted a pilot project in Arusha, Tanzania at the Umoja Youth Centre and returned to Nairobi to work again with Rise and Shine. In 2017, we led workshops for Chicago-based organizations RefugeeOne and The People’s Music School. Most recently, we were guest teaching-artists with CEMUCHCA, Haiti’s premiere training ground for music teachers, for whom TWE offered workshops at their summer camp in Cap-Haïtien, Haiti. Trade Winds Ensemble holds high the inherent dignity and worth of every student with whom we make music. Instead of “teaching” music in a traditional sense, our artist-teachers are often facilitating our students’ learning, helping them to unleash the musicians within themselves, and encouraging them to create music from their own experiences. Each day of our residencies center around a different “Word of the Day” that serves as a unifying topic and point of departure for creating our lesson plans. Examples include “trust”, “voice”, “courage”, “individuality”, “joy”, and others, which draw upon qualities that we both believe we have as artists and are also vital to any individual’s experience in life.

With each partner organization, TWE collaborates to create curricula that fit the unique needs of the students the organization serves. So far, this has meant one-, two-, or three-week residencies which involve experimental composition exercises, creative writing activities, opportunity for self-reflection, body-percussion improvisation, song-writing in teams, drama games, and, if this form of study is relevant and available to our students, instrumental instruction. As a team, we acknowledge that working in sensitive geographic locations requires an ever-evolving mindset that is open to feedback and criticism. Our artist-teachers independently and collectively maintain a commitment to research in an effort to make an impact through our teaching methods in a way that is both respectful and responsible to the populations we serve."

In 2013, I received a bachelor’s in science and education and taught in a K-12 school for four years. I enjoyed teaching, but I always knew it was my parent’s dream, not mine. So, after years of reflecting I decided to follow my two passions - to expressive my creativity with the world and to cater to my inner entrepreneur. I started Hive Five with the skills I learned from teaching and with the mission to share my love of graphic design, corny puns, and cute things. Hive Five will always stand behind its mission to find joy in design. You know when you look at something and it just makes you smile? That's what I want to create."

It quickly expanded from beyond the original goal and now reissues sought after, rare and classic records from the Jungle, Rave, Bleep House, Techno and Jungle Techno genres.

The Vinyl Fanatiks aim is to track down and work with the original artists from the early 1990’s, to reissue their music on vinyl only, and to support the record hunters and vinyl diggers from around the world with quality pressings and superb mastering; a way to show respect and share the story of those that created these incredible records.

The vision is not to focus on the obvious artists of that time but to dig a little deeper and find those that came and went but their legacy still holds true to this day. Some of these producers only released one record and vanished soon after but their music still resonates into the 21st century, accumulating new audiences across the globe, far beyond the catchment of the UK pirate radios and muddy fields of 25 years ago. What happened to these artists? Its Vinyl Fanatik’s mission to find out!

Each record captures a moment in time, a vibe that was true and innocent from a period when music was far more synonymous with rebellion and anarchy than today’s finely polished productions and conformist club pop. This music itself bred on the outskirts of society, fuelled by the passion of the rave, its lineage stemming from the Acid House era of 1988. Often produced on minimal equipment, with minimal skills and knowledge, its audio blueprint transcends to new generations, a rawness that no expensive audio plug in could ever create in this present day.

Vinyl Fanatiks wants to pay homage to these young producers who forged the foundations of the multi-million pound EDM scene we have now. Each of these artists has their own tale to tell, their own memories to share. Limited by their own geographical status within the UK, they somehow still all managed to connect and influence each other, years before the internet, mobile phones and social media that we have today. But the music knew no limits and had no boundaries, transcending generations to this day.

Pay respects to the Architekts!"

His cinematic, elegant style moves the audience deeply, but his gift for improvisation brands him as a stand-out in his genre.

""Genius"" ""breathtakingly beautiful"" are some of the responses.

Nuwanda truly takes you into the deep with his mysterious and powerful relationship with the piano, calling in baroque, cinematic and contemporary themes, and being intimate and personal with the listener whilst taking constant risk and adding an un-graspable quality with his emphasis on playing in the moment.

Nuwanda also has pioneered his career with a multitude of facets from a six year restaurant residency ( Flutterbies Café), giving hundreds of nursing home concerts, producing his own immersive solo show four years in a row dubbed Piano In The Deep, teaching children, appearing at council and festival events, recording albums, collaberating with healers and retreats and currently musical directing and composing - A Midsummers Night Dream for a stage play.

Although quite shy apon meeting Nuwanda, his stage presence and creative capacity are a 'tour de force'.

Nuwanda composes in one go , as if performing, and understatedly channelling a full structured piece, in an instant. Akin to a visual artisit drawing a portrait using a single line, but the sound that comes through is not augmented or some strange contemporary concoction - but sweet, round, warm and relatable melodies and accompaniments come through, really speaking to the listener.

Nuwanda stands confident in this, totally unpretentious with two wishes - that true art heals, and may ears as many as possible hear it, whatever forum it may appear in."

I knew that my Divine purpose is to spread Love through pie.
I've been running my own pie business for 2 1/2 years and hope to be expanding and growing in this endeavor for many years to come!"

I became Marketing Manager at Advent. in 1979 I started a small advertising and marketing company called Hannaher, Nobody & Nobody, with the Tweeter Home Entertainment Group as my first client.

In 1988 I joined Henry Kloss again, along with Tom DeVesto, at Cambridge SoundWorks, where I was Senior Vice President and in charge of product development. In 2003 I had a ""Eureka"" moment at the Consumer Electronics Show when I saw an audio receiver that had 74 sets of inputs and outputs -- and an owner's manual the size of a phone book.

A modern saxophonist of “pure mindfulness and talent” (PopMatters), Nick Zoulek's focus on performance, collaboration, multimedia, and improvisation, has led to a diverse portfolio of distinctive artistic ventures, performing across France, the United Kingdom, Canada, and the United States. As a soloist, Nick’s craft has been lauded as “wickedly contagious” (The Huffington Post) with the capacity to “[take] you to other worlds” (Milwaukee Magazine). The versatility Nick displays on the saxophone has been praised as “[b]eautiful harmonies [singing] in contrast to mysterious knockings and hums, and finally to ungodly, soul-shattering blasts” (Shepherd Express). He has been featured as a soloist with the University of Wisconsin Whitewater Symphonic Wind Ensemble and Symphony Orchestra, as well as the Boulogne Ensemble du Vent. Committed to advancing the classical saxophone, Nick performs frequently as a visiting guest artist at universities across the United States, most recently as the year-long Artist in Residence for the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee SENSORIA series, as well as the Ohio State University, Wayne State University, Kent State University, the University of Wisconsin-River Falls, Missouri Southern State University, and Oklahoma City University. Additionally, he was a fellow at the Eighth Blackbird Creative Lab in Ojai, California. As an interdisciplinary artist, Nick is “a no-holds-barred engine of avant-garde exploration,” (Portland Press Herald). He has served as music director with Wild Space Dance Company, and has scored and performed dance works with the Madison Ballet, HYPERlocal, and with members of Zenon and Like You Mean It dance companies. Nick often works with film and animation, experimenting with the expressive potential of visual media. His films center on self-composed scores, and have been screened at festivals in England, Canada, Serbia, Africa, and around the United States. Nick's media works have garnered numerous awards, including Best Experimental Film from the London Modcon International Film Festival and Largo Film Festival. Nick’s music can be heard on Rushing Past Willow (INNOVA Records), which fuses all of facets of his work through self-composed pieces for alto, tenor, and bass saxophone. Nick maintains an active profile researching the saxophone’s role in contemporary classical music, presenting on contemporary aesthetics and saxophone performance. He has served on faculty at the University of Wisconsin-Whitewater (sabbatical replacement), teaching saxophone and jazz studies courses. He is currently pursuing his Doctor of Musical Arts degree in Contemporary Music Performance at Bowling Green State University with the guidance of Distinguished Artist Professor Dr. John Sampen. Nick holds a Master of Music Performance from BGSU, a Certificat des Études Musicales from the Conservatoire à Rayonnement Régionale de Boulogne-Billancourt, and a Bachelor of Music Performance with Magna Cum Laude honors from the University of Wisconsin-Whitewater.

"512312553:::1118710101:::Hawks With Good Intentions will be the 9th release for L.A. leading country rock folk psychedelic band. Their 2018 release, ""Live And Never Learn,"" was named Top Ten Americana Releases by MOJO Magazine.

The Hawks are noted for their lyrical celebrations and lamentations of earth and ecosphere, odes to the endless highway, and wry social commentary. They've gathered a loyal tribe around the globe, from many U.S. and
Europe/UK tours, consistently rave reviews from critics, and a serious presence in the top 10 of the Freeform American Roots chart (#1 four times), the Americana Chart, and the Euro Americana chart (top ten several times). Their live show, whether all acoustic or hard hitting psychedelic honky tonk electric, lights up the stages from their own Highland Park perch to Stagecoach in the Coachella desert, to the Carolinas and the folk clubs of UK and Germany.

Formed in 1999 by Rob Waller and brothers Paul and Anthony Lacques during a philosophical discussion and rock throwing session on an East Mojave desert trek, I See Hawks In L.A. first gathered on the front porch in Echo Park, Los Angeles, drank whiskey and wrote their first batch of songs. They then sought advice from local country rock guru David Jackson (John Denver, Dillard and Clark, EmmyLou Harris).

Jackson promptly joined the Hawks for their eponymous recording, featuring legendary fiddler Brantley Kearns (Dwight Yoakam, Dave Alvin). The CD established the Hawks signature sound: high lonesome three part harmonies, innovative telecaster and steel or unadorned acoustic arrangements, with lyrics musing on mortality, whales, and the geography of pre-apocalyptic L.A.
The Hawks’ second CD, “Grapevine,” was released on the summer solstice 2004, and immediately went to #1 on the F.A.R. Chart, and hit #2 on XM Radio’s Outlaw Country. With the addition of heavyweight bassist and big league vocalist Paul Marshall (Strawberry Alarm Clock) and Dwight Yoakam’s drummer Shawn Nourse, the Hawks live sound got big and started to rock and psychedelicize.

The Hawks released their third CD, “California Country,” in June 2006, with guest spots from Chris Hillman, Rick Shea, Cody Bryant, Danny McGough, Tommy Funderburk, and other SoCal roots brethren. Tackling subjects like despair in Disney World, blackjack in Jackpot, hippie parenting, donkeys, and Senator Robert Byrd from West Virginia, “California Country” brought more bluegrass, Phase 90 country psychedelia, and steel driven honky tonk to the Hawks sonic empire.

That summer the Hawks hit the road with Tony Gilkyson and Kip Boardman for a 57 show tour of the US and UK: thirty states, two currencies, many varieties of local whiskey, including highland single malts and North Carolina moonshine, not a lot of sleep, and too much fun. Highlights include the Belladrum Festival with peat fires and teepees near Inverness, Scotland; live radio in futuristic BBC studios; a Vermont barn dance; an outdoor festival near Yellowstone and Seattle’s Hempfest; and Joe’s Pub in NYC.
The mid-oughts saw the Hawks embraced by many of their roots predecessors, billed across the country with Lucinda Williams, Dave Alvin, Old 97s, The Mavericks, Peter Case, Bernie Leadon, Chris Hillman and Herb Petersen, Meat Puppets, and Ray Wylie Hubbard.

In March ’08 the Hawks cut their 4th CD “Hallowed Ground,” with some clear Celtic influences and stellar guest spots from fiddlers Gabe Witcher and Dave Markowitz, pedal steeler Dave Zirbel, and accordionist Richie Lawrence. Released to rave reviews, “Hallowed Ground” hit #1 on the Freeform American Roots radio chart, hovering in the top 10 for four months, and hitting #4 on the Euro Americana Chart.

Spring 2010 brought the release of “Shoulda Been Gold” on American Beat records, an ironically titled best of compilation, with early unreleased recordings and five new songs.
“New Kind Of Lonely” was released in 2012, right on time–I See Hawks In L.A. by fate or mysterious internal rhythm put out a CD every other year since their first release. The very personal and somber (except for the comedic moments, of course), all acoustic new music, and a big reception at the FAR West Folk Convention and the national folk convention in Memphis, expanded the Hawks audience to the folk world. Psychedelic honky tonk or old timey acoustic? The Hawks choose both, and both have chosen the Hawks.

2013's Mystery Drug was a return to the surreal and fearless wordplay of early 2000s Hawks method--a reconvening of the tribe, the stellar musicians that enrich the Hawks sound, introducing new drummer and songwriter Victoria Jacobs, with musings on Starbucks baristas as surrogate friends, Irish ancestors trekking across Texas, Comanche ghosts watching aquifers wither, and existence as a moral construct.

Live And Never Learn, released in 2018, debuted at #1 on the FAR Chart and hit the Euro Americana Chart top ten, with multiple rave reviews and solid airplay in Europe/UK. A memorable tour of UK from the southern tip to the wind chilled northern coast of Scotland made a legion of new fans, and boosted the Hawks' already out of control Anglophilia.

I See Hawks In L.A. are headliners at McCabes, Old Town School of Folk Music Chicago, Slims, Joe’s Pub NYC, Grand Performances (L.A.) and other top national venues.

Festival appearances: Stagecoach, Strawberry Festival (CA), Down On The Farm (Halden, Norway), Maverick Fest (UK), Solas Fest (UK), Belladrum Tartan Heart (UK), Hempfest (Seattle), French Broad River Fest (NC), Earagail Arts Festival (Northern Ireland), Westport Bluegrass Festival (Ireland), Celtic Fusion Fest & Earagail Arts Festival (Ireland), Carter Ranch Fest (CA), Frogtown Artwalk (CA), Humboldt Summer Music And Arts Festival (CA), Cadenberge Festival (Germany), Albino Skunkfest (SC), Silverlake Street Scene (CA), Santa Monica Music Festival (CA), Los Feliz Street Scene (CA)

The Good Intentions, from Liverpool, UK, are husband and wife duo Peter Davies and Gabrielle Monk, whose rich harmonies and gorgeous songs earned them Best Americana Band at the British Country Music Awards. They've released four critically acclaimed CDs using the cream of the crop of Los Angeles roots musicians and tour the U.S. and UK often. http://www.thegoodintentions.co.uk/bio

"783136629:::934647504:::The John Byrne Band is led by Dublin native and Philadelphia-based John Byrne. Their debut album, After the Wake, was released to critical acclaim on both sides of the Atlantic in 2011. With influences ranging from Tom Waits to Planxty, John’s songwriting honors and expands upon the musical and lyrical traditions of his native and adopted homes. John and the band followed up After the Wake in early 2013 with an album of Celtic and American traditional tunes. The album, Celtic/Folk, pushed the band on to the FolkDJ Charts, reaching number 36 in May 2015. Their third release, another collection of John Byrne originals, entitled “The Immigrant and the Orphan”, was released in Sept 2015. The album, once again, draws heavily on John’s love of Americana and Celtic Folk music and with the support of DJs around the country entered the FolkDJ Charts at number 40. Critics have called it “..a powerful, deeply moving work that will stay with you long after you have heard it” (Michael Tearson-Sing Out); “The Vibe of it (The Immigrant and the Orphan) is, at once, as rough as rock and as elegant as a calm ocean..each song on this album carries an honesty, integrity and quiet passion that will draw you into its world for years to come” (Terry Roland – No Depression); “If any element of Celtic, Americana or Indie-Folk is your thing, then this album is an absolute yes” (Beehive Candy); “It’s a gorgeous, nostalgic record filled with themes of loss, hope, history and lost loves; everything that tugs at your soul and spills your blood and guts…The Immigrant and the Orphan scorches the earth and emerges tough as nails” (Jane Roser – That Music Mag)

The album was released to a sold-out crowd at the storied World Café Live in Philadelphia and 2 weeks later to a sold-out crowd at the Mercantile in Dublin, Ireland. John has toured with or opened up for acts as diverse as The Hothouse Flowers, Ian Gillan (of Deep Purple), Gaelic Storm, Murder by Death, Finbar Furey, Luka Bloom, The Saw Doctors, The Solas, Sharon Shannon, The Young Dubliners and The Greencards. Both as a solo/acoustic act, and a full 6-piece band, John logs in over 150 shows per year, building a loyal and devoted following. John spent 2017/18 recording and releasing an album of folk songs with his father John Snr. Released under the name “John J.Byrne and the Twangmen” the album has been included in the National Archives in Ireland. His next record, another selection of originals, is scheduled for release in Fall 2019.

IN THE BEGINNING
Sharon Levine and Gavin Callaghan, among other readers, have asked about our early produced material, how we got together, where have we been, how and why we began self-publishing and so forth. Here is a recap for those who missed the story in the pages of The Comics! Snyder has written and edited stories and books including Batman, Katy Keene, Popeye, Steel Sterling, Turok, Son of Stone, and more. Ditko, the original artist on Spider-Man, Dr. Strange, Captain Atom, Dr. Haunt, Konga, Gorgo and others, can also be found in an astonishing list of titles: The Fantastic Four and The Incredible Hulk to The Many Ghosts of Doctor Graves and Witzend. Snyder and Ditko began working together at DC and went on to a variety of publishers, ever seeking opportunity, new ground. You may have seen or heard of some of this work: Charlton Action featuring Static, Flash Gordon, Gobots, The Missing Man, Murder, Tales of the Mysterious Traveler, etc.

EXPLORERS
After years of working for others we struck out on our own. From 1988 to date we have continued earlier features and/or introduced a variety of new characters, concepts and publications. We have published 65 books, hundreds of articles and essays, our little periodical, The Four-Page Series, and the first-person history, The Comics!, now in its 30th year of publication.

Liana Kerzner is an award-winning multimedia professional, writer, analyst and lecturer with 20 years of entertainment industry experience. She is best known, alongside her husband Steven, for Ed the Sock, an iconic Canadian character who also found fame in the USA on G4TV, Ripe TV, EveryJoe.com, and YouTube. She has produced and starred in acclaimed, award-winning content on TV, radio, VOD, and the internet. She was also co-editor of Wrestling With Gods, an award-winning anthology about religion in science fiction and fantasy.

Liana has also written and done video content for various video game sites including The Escapist and Polygon. While at the Escapist, she wrote a four-part report on PTSD, gamers, and therapies that use video game technologies. Her piece for The National Post on “empathy gaming” was short-listed for the inaugural year of the Kunkel Awards. Other awards and nominations include the Canadian Association of Broadcasting Gold Ribbon Finalist, the Prix Aurora Awards, and the Canadian Comedy Awards. She has also been seen talking about video games and gaming culture on... well the list of media outlets is too long.

Her first favorite video game was Pac-Man, or as she called it at the time, bucka bucka. On the Tandy 1000 computer that her mother got as a cast off from work, she discovered King’s Quest and The Ancient Art of War. At school, she was introduced to Apple IIe games like The Oregon Trail, Where In the World Is Carmen Sandiego, and Mystery House.

She discovered video games while living in the very multicultural Jane-Finch neighborhood of Toronto. Kids of all races and genders played video games with her. Therefore, in Liana’s mind, a gamer isn’t automatically a guy, or any other type of person. A gamer is anyone who loves games.

Previous online series include “A Gamer’s Guide to Feminism”, ""Lady Bits"", A four-part series on freedom of speech.

Liana and Steven have recently launched the FU Network (FUN), seeking to equalize, democratize and diversify voices in the media."

As I got older I realized it was about habitat, human-animal conflict, and climate change. I wanted to do more. My mother is a human rights activist and artist, and we collaborated together to create a project that could use art, storytelling, and field research to engage youth activism to inspire change. I don't want my generation to be the last ones to see snow leopards or elephants or rhinos in the wild. But we might be. We need to use our voices to create actionable change with governments, corporations, and our own individual communities if we are going to have a future. I was able to spend a year homeschooling and traveling overseas and during that time I was lucky to deep dive into wildlife conservation and activism. I choose to use graphic novels and streetart as the ways in which I can engage publicly to educate and inspire change. I have been lucky to find mentors and collaborators that believe in me and have helped me bring the vision of my projects to life. I want my voice to matter. I hope you will join me!"

"1572813242:::162816966:::Hey! My name is Bob Richardson, but most people call me Travel Bob. I've been in the travel business for 35 years. I worked for a major airline for 10 years, flying around the world for Free and for the last 25 years I’ve been a travel agent. I’ve lived in Brazil and Vietnam for 19 years, and there’s nothing I love more than traveling! With all my traveling and using numerous neck pillows, I knew there was something missing with each one. As a person that’s spent a good majority of my life up in the air, I always wondered if the designers of all these pillows ever traveled before they designed a pillow. If you’ve tried some of these pillows, I think you’ll agree they haven’t. Well…

I made it my mission to create a travel neck pillow that solved every problem I ever had with all of my old neck pillows and that’s how the TravelBob CoolFab Neck Pillow was born. I wanted something that even the pickiest traveler (like myself) could appreciate. There’s a lot of cheap garbage out there, and I understand most people can spot it a mile away. The CoolFab is the furthest thing from cheap. I’ve gone through every effort to make this the best neck pillow on the market and once you try it out, I think you’ll agree."

"1509163907:::1169839583:::It all started for me when I was invited up to the Green Gulch Zen Center in Marin County, California to observe the Japanese carpenters that returned to complete the Tea House there. Little did I expect to be so completely and utterly life changed on that lovely spring day in 1977. I stayed for a couple of weeks and so it began. Immersed in their every movement and action, quietly absorbing every detail. From then onward was a new life of research, experimentation and discovery. Picking up a few tools to get as close as I could to what it was all about. Delving into making the rice papered shoji screens seen on every houses exterior. Then into the Fusuma interior screens that opened the door to many collaborations with various fabric designers, interior designers and architects that requested flat file units for their robust offices with Tansu designs. My workshop in Palo Alto, CA was buzzing. Ordering thousands of board feet of Port Orford Cedar from Oregon and Incense Cedar from The Sierra Mountains of California as I was getting calls for structures. My first bath house (Ofuro) was to be installed off of a master bedroom in Menlo Park and wound up being included in Sunset Magazine. It was time to take a break. After 8 years of non stop projects, I was finally ready to go to the ""Mother Ship"" and go to Japan as a much needed vacation. With a pocket full of photos of my work, a camera and a back pack, I arrived. Immediately I met a young architect that, after becoming fast friends, set out to dive to the depths of Kyoto. He introduced me to job sites under construction shoji makers. We compiled much needed experiences of their lifestyle, and how they went about things day to day. It lasted nearly two years, living with several families and working with several carpenters. I then returned to work in Palo Alto with 36 rolls of film, brimming with so much input and know how. I was overflowing with confidence and interest was growing all around me of what I have learned and accomplished. I was invited to be included in a Japanese produced book on how to make the shoji screen, a feature article in the San Jose Mercury News' Home and Garden cover story. They discussed a huge remodel for a Tea and bath house in Atherton, CA along with a very large roofed set of entry gates in Walnut Creek, CA with a bath house off their master bedroom. All in Western Cedars. More Mizuya Tansu and shoji orders were coming in regularly from many locations around the bay area. From time to time, I was holding classes in sharpening and joinery in the evenings. An invitation to demonstrate my work at Stanford University lead to working with several grad students that eventually lead to their apprenticeships in my workshop. Needless to say, extremely gratifying opportunities where making their way into my life as a craftsman and teacher. I want to turn up the volume to teach again as I have never been without the fire to do it."

"427391447:::603787564:::Art is a continuous process of becoming. A making and unmaking of each idea, form, shape, line, that moves through the creator to that which is created. We are as much shaped, altered, and invigorated with spirit by the process of creation as that which is created. It is a devotional practice. It is part self-indulgent, part self-sacrifice...once created, it is no longer ours to keep. It lives elsewhere, no longer something to be carried or housed exclusive to ourselves alone. Art is transformation + transmutation; perhaps the richest, most universally recognizable, and diverse language that humans speak. Fluency is the only requirement when turning your heart to gold."

Robb’s widely recognised as one of the UK’s finest songwriters. “An English original”, (Robin Denselow, the Guardian) ... “the real deal when it comes to songwriting,” (Mike Harding, BBC Radio2). He gigs in the UK, Belgium, Germany & the USA. His songs are covered by many singers, from folk legend Roy Bailey to cabaret diva Barb Jungr. His album 1997 double album Gentle Men was a Daily Telegraph “Folk Album of the Year.” He is credited as giving cohesion to the genre “English Chanson”, & performs as a solo artist & with a noisy electric band The Irregulars. In 2012 the song When Tottenham Burned, from the band album Happily Ever After, was named by FATEA as their “Song of the Year”. 2013 saw the release of Bring Down The Moon, an album recorded with a largely acoustic band, & West Pier Serenade, a limited edition vinyl LP issued on Record Store Day, & in the autumn the release of a new, revised version of Gentle Men, Robb’s family history of the First World War & its consequences, that received unanimous critical acclaim. For Record Store Day 2014 Robb released a 7” single acoustic version of the Velvet Underground’s Sweet Jane, & in the summer released a new acoustic guitar-based album of politically charged material Us & Them – “Robb Johnson keeps folk music relevant & thought-provoking. Us & Them shows what can be created by one man & a guitar,” (The Living Tradition). Christmas 2014 Robb released a traditional Christmas single, available as a7” vinyl at gigs & via mail order from his website, & as a download via Proper Distribution. A double A side, Make Believe is a postpunk band track, in traditional xmas knees-up stylee, referencing various instances of story & belief from Winnie The Pooh to Mikhail Bulgakov, with added chime bars & jingle bells. When My Grandfather Played Football is an acoustic guitar-based song originally commissioned by Billy Bragg as part of the 14-18 NOW project that took place at last year’s Glastonbury festival, that remembers the Christmas 1914 truce. Both songs feature Brighton – based Community Quire Hullabaloo. In 2016 PM Press in America put out a 5 CD anthology box set ""A Reasonable History of Impossible Demands"", & Christmas 2016 I released another Christmas single ""JC 4 PM for Me"" as a result of working with ""Stand Up for Labour"".

"1835825547:::1239977117:::Joshua D. Moody was born and raised in Dallas, TX. He graduated from David W. Carter High School where playing football helped him to avoid the trouble that tempted other students who didn’t participate in extracurricular activities. The violence common in his neighborhood as well as at school inspired the first scenes in FOUR MY BROTHERS. Joshua always had a passion for putting smiles on people’s faces through entertainment such as acting, comedy, and just living his everyday life, but his focus shifted when he visited his older brother in prison for the first time. They sat silently staring at each other for a full 30 minutes, because his brother was literally in shock and speechless about what the next 16 years behind bars was going to be like, all because of the bad decisions he’d made. This experience motivated Joshua to research what really goes on inside prisons, and what inmates mentally go through after they are institutionalized. Joshua started interviewing ex-inmates, recording their testimonies in a composition book. He discovered that he, like the general American population, had no clue about prison statistics and what actually goes on behind bars. From his notes, Joshua decided to pour all of the information he had learned into a movie script. He’s making FOUR MY BROTHERS not just for his own brother’s sake, but for everyone who has a loved one in the system, and hopefully to keep others out.


Joshua is married to his lovely wife and has two beautiful children."

"2140918729:::1772711842:::Heroic Fantasy Quarterly is an ezine dedicated to publishing short works of heroic fantasy. More than that, through both prose and poetry we hope to hearken back to an older age of storytelling — an age when a story well told enthralled audiences. Traits of great oral storytelling survive the ages to influence treasures of literature, the pulps, radio plays, late-night game sessions, and now Heroic Fantasy Quarterly.

Our favorite storytellers, a few ancient and a few not, deliver action, reaction, and repercussion — and rarely divulge the thought processes that guide a character. These storytellers know that sometimes an audience just wants to see what happens next, that sometimes it’s more interesting to watch a person open a box than to hear about why he or she decided to open it in the first place.

Here’s a little more, then, about what you’ll find inside the HFQ box . . .

As our name suggests, Heroic Fantasy Quarterly isn’t limited to stories about swordsmen or far-traveling adventurers; it’s also about fantastical lands and magicks and creatures — both friend and foe — which together make heroic fantasy tales memorable and distinct from other sorts of stories.

But the tales at HFQ share another quality no less important than any other: our prose starts fast, with an emphasis on action. Be it an exchange of blows or insults, the spurring-on of steed, or the application of poultices to wounds, things happen and happen quickly in the pages of HFQ."

I was first introduced to the amazing qualities of sustainable, technical fibers while developing a line of active wear for a client. This is when I started imagining how perfect these textiles would be for the lounge dresses I dreamed of wearing, but could not find anywhere. When I got pregnant my desire for super comfortable sleep and loungewear that would also meet my style requirements became even stronger. As women we go through so many different stages in our lives when being comfortable is a number one priority, but why should comfortable mean boring or unflattering? “This is when I decided that I wanted to make stylish, comfortable and sustainable loungewear, starting with beautiful dresses, for myself and every other modern woman out there wanting a better option than what is available in this category today.”"

I'm passionate about being an LGBT ambassador, advocate, campaigner and educator. I've never hid in the shadows, denied my feelings, with whomever around me, and treasure life's magical gift. As part of my own historic legacy, its vital, and means so much to share and tell my own story and feelings, with those sympathetic, or not to my interest.

I have a love of gay culture, art and politics, and to witness its positive progression of change and acceptance means a lot. I've travelled the world visiting synonymous places connected with gay culture. The Castro district of San Francisco, and the story of Harvey Milk, Laramie, and the story of Matthew Shepard, and the national historic landmark of The Stonewall Inn, New York, site of the 1969 riots that launched the gay rights movement. These are just some of the places visited as part of my own cultural education.

In 2011 I made a documentary in tribute of Jonathan Harvey's coming of age love story, Beautiful Thing. It was called A Film Made In Thamesmead, and one of the most profound, rewarding projects I've ever completed. Please see my you tube link to see parts of this documentary. www.youtube.com/user/tibbley

In November of 2017, I first saw Call Me By Your Name. I was transfixed by the power of this film, and I left the auditorium with my heart literally hurting. I knew straight away that I wanted to shout out loud about this film, and share some of its phenomena with you. The Heart That Hurts will be completed by September 2021.

Thank you for your support.
