"946048492:::113337413:::Kyle VonKubik:::My journey to becoming an artist began the same way as most: through doodles produced in primary school whilst being expected to complete some monotonous worksheet meant to prevent a student from getting up out of his or her chair. My love for doodling, however, continued on long after I baffled countless teachers and professors. As an adult, I found that my drawings got me through the day and kept my mind active. While I, as my my peers, came to terms with the necessity of the 9-5 grind, I was always able to enter back into the fun, light, and easy world within my doodles. As a natural effect of my process, what I have created (and hope to continue creating) is a semi-conscious amalgamation of what is going on around me as well as a reflection on what has been and still could be.

This led them to develop a strong understanding of the Japanese culture – and language –, and to lead a number of projects closely related to some of its greatest composers and artists.


Dedicated to the promotion of music first and foremost, Wayô Records is a label driven by passion, but also by ambition and a strong sense of respect for the composers and their work. On top of publication and event planning, the Wayô team is also contributing to a number of projects related to localization, production and coordination – not only in the music field, but also video games and animated movies.


Formed by the kanji “Wa” meaning “Japan” (和) and “Yô” meaning the West (洋), the name Wayô symbolizes our desire to bring Japanese and Western artists together.


The evocative Wayô logo has been created by Okinawan calligrapher Shusui Taba, who comments:


“The character 洋 bears the value of humankind, the birth of life. Just like the foetus is nourished by the amniotic fluid (羊水), Japanese culture grows thanks to Wayô.”:::1228:::213:::0.11904761904761905:::0.3:::1:::0:::2017|||"

This life background is the key of my commitment with a more tolerant, open and respectful world of diversity, as we stand for in Azuei.
We've decided to host the campaign because Haiti and DR are not eligible for Kick Starter.:::581:::105:::0.041666666666666664:::0.1875:::1:::0:::2019|||"

Janice is a frequent cooperative gamer and occasional solo gamer. She's the lead game designer and graphic designer of Assembly and Sensor Ghosts. Janice is also a qualified professional Project and Product Manager with most of her experience lying in high-tech, high value products. She's taken several products from an idea through to manufacture, including inventing her own technology as part of her PhD.

Stu is also the big solo gamer amongst the two of us. He has pretty high standards for solo games and has extensively tested and helped to develop both the solo and 2-player variants for Assembly and Sensor Ghosts.

He began working professionally to reduce big money in politics in 1995 with such nonpartisan organizations as Common Cause and the Public Interest Research Group. As US PIRG’s democracy program director, he was the first professional advocate in Washington, DC, to support a constitutional amendment to limit campaign spending.

As director of Common Cause’s Amend 2012 campaign, Derek was the architect behind voter instruction measures in Montana, Colorado, Massachusetts, and California, where voters demanded Congress pass an amendment to overturn the Supreme Court’s ruling in Citizens United v. FEC.

In 2014, Derek Cressman ran for California secretary of state. Though he didn’t win his election, the legislature responded to his campaign, and the efforts of others, by referring a question to the ballot instructing Congress to overturn the Citizens United ruling—the central plank of Derek’s campaign platform.

Derek has testified before committees of the United States Senate, California State Assembly and Senate, and California Fair Political Practices Commission; served as an expert in federal litigation; and authored and coauthored numerous reports. Derek has appeared extensively in the media, including the Associated Press, Roll Call, The Hill, National Journal, USA Today, the New York Times, Los Angeles Times, Christian Science Monitor, Washington Times, Boston Globe, San Francisco Chronicle, San Jose Mercury News, Sacramento Bee, Atlanta Journal-Constitution, Austin American-Statesman, Orlando Sentinel, Albuquerque Journal, and Kansas City Star.

When he’s not working to improve our democracy, Derek enjoys spending time with his wife and two daughters. He credits his time running marathons and mountaineering with building his fortitude to tackle obstacles like the US Supreme Court. He is an avid woodworker and picks at the banjo when he needs a break. Derek grew up in Colorado Springs and graduated cum laude from Williams College in 1990 with a degree in political science.:::2212:::345:::0.0586489898989899:::0.3098021885521885:::2:::2:::2015|||"

I'm like God controlling my little children hehehe...wait is that out loud?

like to watch a lot of science fiction films, fantasy films, some contemporary, little dramas, horrors (that aren't stereotypes) etc. If you are curious by what type of music I listen to, we'll I listen to soundtracks, New Age, classical music, Latino, hip hop, underground rap, underground hip hop, soft rock, and metal. You also caught the part that I like some pop music. Writing and reading has always been like a drug to me. Whenever I put words on a page I'm always pulled out from my chair into a world that I create, writing the sounds envisioned in my head, imagining myself in the pages where the words flow. These are the things us writers tend to see when we are high with the pen.:::1066:::202:::0.021811294765840223:::0.33858815426997246:::7:::2:::2016|||"

I design butterfly gardens, compost, sew, and find whimsical uses for upcycled things. Once, I transformed a door into a pond, a vintage awning into a French garden, and a few headboards + bike rims into a Steampunk trellis. I’ve spent years turning common trash into amazing soil and I’m so ready to share this beautiful, simple, yet revolutionary book of composting secrets, called “Fail-Proof Composting”.

Miracle Haven is the name of my business and also a real garden with an inviting, grey, curvy gate where I test ideas, compost wearing a storm trooper helmet, teach gardening classes, and enjoy bonfires with awesome friends and family. Please join the fun @miraclehavengarden or @rebelcompost on Instagram or facebook (links below).

I’ve had fun touring gardens in the United States from coast to coast, as well as in Turkey, Canada, Mexico and Israel for inspiration; and have been certified through Smartscape, as well as ALCA (Arizona Certified Landscape Professionals). I enjoy being a Master Gardener volunteer and logged over 240 volunteer hours helping with projects and tours. In college I studied advanced sewing & flat pattern design and hope to Kickstart a Steampunk composting video after this book is successful. More about that in the future! I’m an Arizona native (love sunshine), happily-hitched, with two adult kids, three grand-littles and an adorable Silkie Terrier named Sailor.

Over the past few months I have been dealing with adversity when creating my art. Due to people leaving mean comments on my art and stealing art equipment, I have been very paranoid and stressed when creating my art. This has resulted in my studio not being a safe space for me to work and has led to the concern that someone is going to destroy my art or damage me in general.
To combat the difficulty, I really want to create art in a more positive light. I really want to thrive in contrast to the negativity I have faced. I want to get back to making work that can change people in a positive light and to do this I need to roll with the punches and make them blossom.:::1501:::282:::0.11016414141414141:::0.4139772727272727:::1:::1:::2015|||"

"350669117:::1009883340:::Angela Baby Says:::I was home one day creating baby accessories on the table, while watching my oldest daughter interact with her newborn sister. The older sibling was frustrated that she couldn't really play much with the baby because she was too little. So she sketched a small drawing on a little chalkboard to present it as a gift to her baby sister. That was a light bulb moment! Why not create a baby shoe with an outsole made out of chalkboard material? Older siblings can create ""gifts"" for their younger siblings to wear. Parents can write out the age of the baby for the month-to-month photos. Expectant parents can write the gender for reveals, or the due date for pregnancy announcements.

I put the accessories aside and thought out what this would look like. I have been working tirelessly through many obstacles to get this never-before-seen patent-pending Chalkboard Shoe perfected and into your home!

Chalkboard Shoes by Baby Says provides parents and caregivers a new means of expression for their non-walking babies. The soles can be decorated with our safe, non-toxic chalk markers and personalized with dates, names, or phrases.

Perfect for pregnancy announcements, gender reveals, photo shoots, family gatherings, sporting events, holidays, month-to-month milestones...the possibilities are endless!

The shoes you purchase today are durable, well-designed, and most importantly: safe for you and your child to enjoy.
I sincerely hope you enjoy these shoes with your little ones, and create many memories that will be cherished for years to come! What does YOUR baby say?:::1585:::255:::0.14539772727272726:::0.30674242424242426:::1:::0:::2019|||"

"1685435020:::1941935920:::SASQUATCH BBQ:::Hey everyone, My name is Matt Crawford but most folks just call me “Squatch” these days. I live and operate Sasquatch BBQ from beautiful Washington State, or the “PNW” (Pacific Northwest) as we call it around here. Cooking meat in the outdoors has been my passion for nearly as long as I can remember. Not a day goes by that I don’t wish to be serving up meals surrounded by friends, family, fir trees, the smell of dirt, moss, fire, and crystal clear waters. There is just something so primal about lighting up some wood, cranking up a flame, and slapping down some meat on a hot grate. It gets me all fired up just thinking about it!

Being Sasquatch has become a lifestyle for myself and many others, it’s about getting out there off-grid with friends or alone sometimes and just being basic. No phones, no distractions, just food and the elements. In just a short amount of time, a ton of hard work and a lot believing in myself, this whirlwind of social media acceptance and embracement of the “Sasquatch Lifestyle” has taken me from a day job at the local homeless shelter, to a man on a mission bringing strangers, friends, families, and anything in between closer together over a hot meal and firelight. Grateful is an understatement for how I feel about the companies that believe in Sasquatch with their sponsorships and support, and most of all the people out there always enjoying the next Squatchy adventure full of meals, laughs big Sasquatch hugs and beautiful backdrops. Can’t wait to “Meat” you all, the journey continues………… Follow along Instagram Facebook and YouTube @sasquatchbbq:::1602:::291:::0.15503673094582185:::0.33866161616161616:::1:::3:::2019|||"

Regardless of the subject, my artwork is an act of reverence for what I “see” and it springs from both tapping my intuition and cultivating artistic technique.

Conducted by Benjamin Zander, the BPYO’s motto is “Shaping Future Leaders Through Music.” BPYO provides an environment for musical excellence and leadership development that strengthens communication and deepens the human experience: a unique opportunity for young instrumentalists to study great orchestral repertoire in a musically dynamic and intellectually challenging community.

The 120 enthusiastic and talented young musicians of the BPYO range in age from 12 to 21. BPYO members communicate with Mr. Zander and each other about the musical process, often leading to stimulating discussions on personal leadership and effective contribution. This process yields surprising results: as Lloyd Schwartz, formerly of the Boston Phoenix remarked, “I wish more professional orchestras played as thrillingly as this.” At the conclusion of its inaugural season in June, 2013, BPYO undertook a wildly successful tour of the Netherlands. Though nobody knew the orchestra when it set out on the tour, by the final performance in Amsterdam BPYO was received with a sold-out house and a standing ovation! In December, 2013, BPYO made its Carnegie Hall debut. In June, 2015, BPYO performed 8 concerts in the Czech Republic, Germany, and Switzerland, and in June, 2016 BPYO returned to Carnegie Hall for two concerts, before crossing the Atlantic to perform six concerts in Spain. 2017 saw an expansive tour to Peru, Argentina, and Uruguay, followed by a whirlwind tour of Europe's finest concert halls in 2018.

Each international engagement has been met with top critical approval and formed friendships between the orchestra members and those they have touched through their music.:::1794:::279:::0.13572916666666665:::0.3486458333333333:::5:::0:::2013|||"

Like many women, DeAnna struggled with PMS and for many years viewed her period as a bother and a nuisance. In 1992 she began a personal journey toward embracing her monthly cycle, which led her to “reverse the curse!” Having already been a trained coach and facilitator at the time, she called her first Menstrual Empowerment circle in 1994. The response was overwhelming, and the journey embarked upon — profound. In 1995 DeAnna coined the term ‘INNER MAIDEN’ as a result of recognizing the deep need in all women for soothing, healing, and reclaiming the adolescent girl within, who may have never been welcomed into womanhood.:::700:::121:::0.18333333333333335:::0.42000000000000004:::1:::2:::2014|||"

I am co-founder and editor of the artist-led publication None of The Above.

"1954823056:::702527881:::Nicole Holly Grace:::I have been passionate about theatre for a long time, particularly about telling stories I believe should be heard that spark discussions to make a difference for both men and women. This is exactly what I feel Jennie Webb’s writing does, she is an American playwright and coming across her writing felt like finding a treasure that I am desperate to share! Most of the topics are close to my heart, while showing them in an abstract and slightly humorous light (those who know me know my love for comedy!).

I currently have a STRONG cast, an amazing theatre on board and everything in place, but as I am making this happen off my own back, I unfortunately do not quite have the funds for it. I have so far self funded all my training by working hard and earning scholarships since a young age and am passionate about making my own path in this industry. However this is a new season to invite others to join me and see the collaboration of talent I have been privilege to find on my journey so far. The plays we are working on include themes of respecting women’s choices regarding pregnancy, rape, suicide and the effect technology has on our communication. I sincerely appreciate any support you are able to give to bring this exciting project to life.

"905198215:::1439972235:::Christopher Jones:::Hey there! My name is Chris. I'm a father, creator, and accidental storyteller. When my kids were young, I used to turn on soundtracks and tell them bedtime stories. Instead of getting them sleepy, it awakened a part of them I didn't see anywhere else. It was a fun tradition. Then, over the years, I'd invite friends, family, and employees try their hand at music inspired storytelling. Each time I saw someone try telling a story with music in the background, it worked! Since then, I've built a game that has an app with over 1,000 totally rad songs, a bunch of Spark Cards designed to spark storytelling, and some ways to turn storytelling into a game.

Back my project and help me take the magic of storytelling to the world. I've never tried this before and am excited to see the power of community to help ideas come to life.:::834:::156:::0.06893939393939394:::0.21515151515151515:::2:::0:::2018|||"

With a diverse background spanning multiple industries such as politics, music, and retail -- the common thread is my passion to curate the story behind each brand. I’m driven by the need for genuine connectivity in such an artificially digital world. By emboldening the vision, I understand how to tap into the human spirit and carefully craft immersive experiences -- allowing individuals to intrinsically connect with brands on a deeper level. I embrace authenticity and translate originality into all stages of a project -- from ideation to development and culminating with a polished product. Equipped with the entrepreneurial mindset, I thrive at leading tasks and developing confident solutions. However, the best work is achieved while working collaboratively -- which is why I strive to empower teams through valuing creative expression and leveraging charisma to seek our highest potential.

A disruptive outlook on life warrants a non-traditional education to compliment such a perspective. Thus, I decided to study at The New School -- Parsons School of Design // Eugene Lang College of Liberal Arts. Not one to follow the status quo, I designed my own university major. Titled “Creative Entrepreneurship” I formulated a curriculum rooted in social engagement, business fundamentals, and creative strategy. My entrepreneurial journey has both inspired and invigorated me to continue my career calling of influencing lives for the better. More specifically, I treasure the profound moments -- opportunities where I’m able to sharpen ideas and elevate products and services into memorable experiences.:::1767:::270:::0.22432498057498057:::0.5448475135975136:::1:::0:::2019|||"

"1997293074:::1079273410:::Martin MÃ¼ller:::->Deutsche Version weiter unten<- _____________________
Since his earliest childhood, Martin Müller (born 1975 in
Mannheim) has a strong enthusiasm for technical and, above all, remote-controlled toys of all kinds. At the age of 10, he started the remote-controlled model flight. Today he is eight-time German and vice-world champion in indoor aerobatics, a class, which he decisively co-founded. Almost 100% of all the competition models used today in this international sports class are based on a design principle which is just one of its innumerable innovations in this field. This passion and his profession as a designer and product developer could be combined in many cases well. Among other things, he headed the development department of a medium-sized company, which developed remote-controlled model helicopter, for five years. There he was also responsible for marketing and public relations. Numerous of today's, even available in supermarkets, toy helicopters go back on developments this time. Martin has been operating his own design office for more than 10 years focusing on product development and innovative pre-development projects for the automotive industry. He worked in the field of engine construction / passenger car exhaust gas turbochargers as well as projects in the field of hybrid and fuel cell technologies. In addition, products for the model building market were repeatedly developed, licensed or, in some cases, self-realized and marketed. ____________________________________________________

Seit seiner frühesten Kindheit hegte Martin Müller (geb. 1975 in
Mannheim) eine ausgeprägte Begeisterung für technische und vor allem ferngesteuerte Spielzeuge jeglicher Art. Im Alter von 10 Jahren begann er mit dem ferngesteuerten Modellflug. Heute ist er achtfacher Deutscher-, und Vizeweltmeister im Indoor- Kunstflug. Eine Sparte, die er maßgeblich mitbegründet und geprägt hat. Nahezu 100% aller heute in dieser internationalen Sportklasse eingesetzten Wettbewerbsmodelle basieren auf einem Konstruktionsprinzip (Kreuzrumpf-Bauweise, bzw. ShockFlyer), welches nur eine seiner unzähligen Innovationen in diesem Bereich ist.
Diese Leidenschaft und sein Beruf als Konstrukteur und Produktentwickler ließen sich in vielen Fällen gut miteinander verbinden. So leitete er unter anderem fünf Jahre lang die Entwicklungsabteilung eines mittelständischen Unternehmens, welches ferngesteuerte Modell-Helikopter entwickelte. Zudem war er dort in den Bereichen Marketing und Öffentlichkeitsarbeit mit verantwortlich. Zahlreiche der heute selbst in Supermärkten erhältlichen Spielzeughelikopter gehen auf Entwicklungen dieser Zeit zurück.
Seit mehr als 10 Jahren betreibt Martin ein eigenes
Konstruktionsbüro mit Schwerpunkt auf Produktentwicklung und
innovativen Vorentwicklungsprojekten für die Automobilindustrie. Für Letztere im Bereich Motorenbau/PKW-Abgasturbolader sowie Projekte im Bereich der Hybrid- und Brennstoffzellen-Technologien. Daneben wurden immer wieder auch Produkte für den Modellbaumarkt entwickelt, in Lizenz vergeben oder teilweise auch selbst realisiert und vertrieben.:::3134:::414:::0.059944444444444446:::0.11561111111111112:::2:::8:::2016|||"

That woodgrain print is embedded in my mind. I still collect cards to this day, but have gravitated towards non-sports. There is something special about non-sports cards in that they are always relevant. Mark Hamill will never be traded to another team and will forever be Luke Skywalker. Ron Perlman will not pull his hamstring and miss the next 4-6 ""games"" of Hellboy. I developed the itch to produce my own set in 2014, but always had a reason not to pursue it. Since then I've spent time talking to many of the small presses who continue to put out innovative and fun non sports sets. With their support and generous knowledge sharing I've decided to take the plunge.

In late 2015, we converted our attic into heated/cooled livable square footage.

To that end, we approach each project by first understanding the unique phenomenological qualities and cultural influences inherent in a site, and then deploying our design interventions to embrace, reveal, and often embellish these qualities as they evolve over time. By doing so, we aim to cultivate landscape as fundamental expressive layer to our cities and towns.

"1518161987:::351925712:::Sarah Peacock:::1.2 million miles, 2,800 shows, and fourteen years of flying solo is quite a road trip. Sarah Peacock’s music has a raw and fiercely unique way of telling the truth, and her songs are like a gypsy caravan of influences from Americana, blues, roots, and soul. Held hostage by her record label at 21, the troubadour life came with a rude awakening for the young Georgia native. Peacock made her home in a ‘92 Volvo with her dog and a guitar, and for nearly seven years earned a living in the corner shadows of American dive bars. The tables turned in 2011 when an anonymous fan helped Peacock buy out of her recording contract. Since then, she has released six additional albums and won multiple awards for her songwriting. “Hurricane” won Best Song in the American Songwriting Awards, and “Beautiful” was a winner with International Unsigned Only. “The Cool Kids,” and “Are We There Yet” have nominated her for Best Female Artist and Best Song in a number of songwriting competitions. Peacock was also named Listening Room Network’s Artist of the Year. In 2013, Peacock released her self-produced album, Albuquerque Sky, recorded in hotel rooms across the country while maintaining her rigorous 250 show tour schedule. Albuquerque Sky was followed by a season of goodbyes, tremendous growth, and challenges, and became the catalyst for her next album, Dream On (2016). “This record helped me get un-stuck. I had a collection of live recordings which became Dream On. After such a creative dry spell, I knew I needed to hit the road and stay out a while – reconnect with my fans,” says a determined Peacock. “I found this old silver eagle tour bus in Austin, TX. I was so enchanted with it, and the renovation process really reigniting my troubadour flame. So I bought my very first bus. Oh, what a feeling!” But less than 4 months later, she would watch it burn to the ground at a California truck stop. One of Peacock’s fans voluntarily initiated a fundraiser, which is what kept her on the road. Another fan, so touched by her story, donated his motor home so that her tour could go on. That special connection between Sarah Peacock and her fans is what gives her the strength to continue overcoming. “You have to be unstoppable, even when you don’t believe you are.” That’s the modus operandi for the now half Tennessean, half Texan road warrior. Sarah Peacock is active in the anti-bullying community, and her song, “The Cool Kids” has become a powerful anti-bullying anthem. Its message has taken on a life of its own. As she travels the country, Peacock shares her story in schools, empowering young people to embody her message of kindness and love. Peacock is also an animal lover and tours with her pups as often as she can. Her late road dog, Gibson, was one of the first canines to receive a prosthetic mitral valve in a clinical trial at CSU in Ft. Collins, CO in May of 2017. Unfortunately, Gibson passed away. To honor his memory, Peacock recently formed her own 501(c)3, The Band Waggin,’ benefiting various animal health and rescue programs throughout the United States. After completing two EP’s for Nashville label, American Roots Records, Peacock plans to release a full length album on her own label in 2019. Sarah Peacock is the truest definition of a self-made overcomer, hustler, and DIY machine. She’s got a remarkable knack for finding beauty in the ashes, and there’s no denying the future is looking bright for this tenacious up and comer.:::3465:::635:::0.11582672535797536:::0.34139680631868136:::4:::14:::2012|||"

Design had always been a passion of mine so when a friend introduced me to Etsy- it was love at first sight. I could design during naptime, earn a little extra income for diapers and have a creative outlet too! I’ve since developed my then hobby into a full grown graphic design firm, Newbury Rain. All built right here in Trumbull, CT, out of a passion for entrepreneurship & design. We are proud to have created jobs in our community and contribute to our local economy.

The Adv3nture brand has brought together an amazing group of people with experience in the technical aspects of fashion design and in high quality outerwear. We all share the commonality of love of travel, love of the outdoors, and the appreciation of nature... and the occasional adult beverage. Our goal is the production of garments and accessories of exceptional quality that maintain integrity in specific weather conditions. In addition, we require these garments to perform functions not normally found in ""common"" clothing and to enhance all travel experiences. Whether these travel experiences be a walk around town, a tailgating party, a sojourn throughout Europe, or a hike through the snow, we have you in mind. Another commonality found in our amazing group? The desire to give back. The Adv3nture team has achieved this important goal by launching our tree initiative program, which begins immediately in alignment with this Kickstarter release. We will be planting three tree with every item purchased. We felt that this wide outreach program addressed all of our concerns about air quality, ecosystem restoration, loss of wild places, and indigenous animal loss. Those who have backed our previous successful campaign are familiar with our quality, and we know you will be happy with our innovative gear.

"185430731:::1044703472:::AcousticSheep LLC:::AcousticSheep LLC was founded in 2007 by Dr. Wei-Shin Lai, a family physician, and her husband Jason Wolfe, a video game developer. Dr. Lai struggled with getting back to sleep after patient phone calls in the middle of the night. She needed to listen to some meditative music to help her relax. But headphones were bulky, and ear buds were uncomfortable. Since there were no headphones specifically designed for sleeping on the market, she invented her own and called them SleepPhones.

They worked so well for her that she decided she had to offer them to all of her patients taking sleeping pills. Her husband soldered and she sewed the first 500 pieces themselves on their kitchen table. Initial feedback was phenomenal. One lady was able to come off of sleeping pills after taking them for 10 years. Another saved her marriage because she could finally sleep in the same bed as her snoring husband. Dr. Lai and her husband decided to patent their invention and start a real business. They completely sold out in their first year.

For the first 6 years, Jason and Wei-Shin ran the kitchen table business out of their house. After selling 100,000 pieces, they decided to take their business to the next level, hiring their first full-time employee and setting up their warehouse in Erie, PA. Since leaving their day jobs in 2013, Jason and Wei-Shin have won numerous awards as Entrepreneur of the Year in PA (SBA), Entrepreneur of the Year in Western PA & WV (Ernst & Young), and Small Business of the Year with the Consumer Technology Association. They have won 8 Consumer Electronics Association Innovation Awards for their products, 2 Pennsylvania ImPAct Awards (Entrepreneur and Exports), and a Red Dot Design Award. Locally, they have won the Disrupt Erie Award, Ben Franklin Award, and the Commitment to Erie Award.

From designing and manufacturing tremendously helpful products to running a fun, innovative company, Wei-Shin and Jason look forward to growing AcousticSheep to offer a fresh, new, natural sleep solution to everyone worldwide.:::2059:::339:::0.09393237934904601:::0.3474957912457913:::2:::22:::2009|||"

"1318438427:::2101163923:::Monstrous Regiment Publishing:::Monstrous Regiment Publishing Ltd is a micropress based in a wee flat in Leith, Edinburgh, founded by two MSc Publishing graduates while still at uni in 2017. The co-directors do this voluntarily, around their other commitments, because they really believe in it. Their passion for publishing working class writers, as well as topics of intersectional feminism and sexuality led them on a mission to curate bold and fresh content; the stuff they felt was often missing from bookshelves. In 2018 Monstrous expanded to include one contracted in-house designer and two student assistant interns (paid in stipends). This Kickstarter will allow the team to fund the newly designed edition of The Bi-ble and – for the first time – Volume Two: New Testimonials. Having this funded will be a gamechanger for the wee press and will allow it to survive and keep growing for another year (though we don’t know just yet where in the wee flat we’ll manage to store all the books)! The costs for indie press survival are increasingly terrifying, and 2019 will be a make or break year for Monstrous Regiment depending on this Kickstarter.

"583688323:::1494220164:::Kenny K. Low:::Kenny K. Low is Malaysian-born, US-raised, and currently calls Singapore home. Professionally, he’s a card-carrying member of the corporate execs club, spending his days focused on the development, investment, and financing of global infrastructure projects. It’s this success in the corporate world that helped him reconnect with his true passion: singing.

Ever since his childhood days performing in church and school concerts, Kenny felt profoundly connected to the musical arts. From the legendary voices of the 80s (Barry Manilow, Lionel Richie, Kenny Rogers), to industry leaders of the early 2000s like Michael Bublé, he draws inspiration from the rich sound and emotion of ballads and love songs. These artists were instrumental in shaping his personal singing style.

Unfortunately, in early adulthood Kenny discovered how difficult it is to balance a bustling professional life while moonlighting as a performer. His singing had to take a backseat during the formative years of his career. Though he’d never really considered a life as a professional singer, he still felt a twinge of jealousy watching several friends attain musical fame.

Ironically, it was this same corporate gig that reignited his singing aspirations. The mid-2000s found Kenny entertaining business associates in karaoke lounges around the world. Beneath the spotlight on those stages around the world, he felt truly alive. He soon developed a repertoire of songs that had folks telling him he could have pursued a second career as a singer.

Still, it took another decade of honing his skills to take the leap and sign on with TTF Records. Together, they’re producing a record of cover ballads and love songs spanning the 1970s to the end of this ‘20s decade. Through this mix of cover songs, Kenny hopes to pay homage to the legends who helped shape him and leave his mark on the industry that he loves. He wants to inspire his own children to pursue their dreams, no matter how difficult or impossible they may seem, because he’s finally learned that happiness is more important than wealth and prestige. As the cliché goes, better late than never, and to quote author Tom Butler-Bowdon, it’s “Never Too Late to Be Great.”:::2217:::373:::0.11921296296296295:::0.3223148148148148:::1:::0:::2019|||"

I have been a fan and supporter of games (especially roleplaying games) for decades, with old favorites including Call of Cthulhu and RuneQuest II, while my new favorites are the collaborative games that have emerged in the last couple of decades, both in the form of GMless story games as well as in board games.

Professionally, I've done considerable work in the computer game industry: I was lead designer for Castle Marrach and Lovecraft Country online games and producer for mobile adaptions of several strategy games by Reiner Knizia and Michael Schacht. In the tabletop games industry, I produced Chaosium's award-winning Beyond the Mountains of Madness RPG supplement, resurrected Arkham Horror cooperative board game before licensing it to Fantasy Flight for their bestselling 2nd edition, and I support the tabletop gaming community as the owner/publisher of the popular website RPG.net.

"95754885:::985731419:::Daniel McMillan:::Hello Everyone! I find a deep satisfaction when I am sitting at my desk, moving a plot forward or being surprised by something one of my characters does. There is an exciting interaction that goes on between an author and the characters and plots that come out of the writing process. Even though I have an outline that lays a basic template for the story, I still find myself amazed or annoyed with things my characters say and do. They take on a life of their own, and I act as an intermediary between them and their outcomes. It is thrilling to see my heroes win the day or grow as people, and it hurts when they suffer. I laugh along with them when they are enjoying themselves, and I sometimes need to take a breather and pull myself together when their lives suck. I love to see the villains getting their just desserts, and I am sometimes shocked at the terrible things they do. Those horrible actions and dastardly deeds came out of my imagination! How can I dream up such angry, atrocious, malevolent crap when I'm basically such a nice guy? Where does that come from? The process is fun, and I derive great pleasure from seeing where things go in a story I am developing. When I am outlining a plot, it astonishes me that certain characters end up in certain places as a story reaches its climax and conclusion. As I write out the individual scenes, I am sometimes shocked at the things they say and have a strong emotional reaction to writing about their hardships and pain.

"44316938:::576436014:::You Tune:::Jeremiah Smith received his Doctorate of Audiology degree from Central Michigan University and has extensive experience in acoustics and hearing healthcare. After graduation he turned his doctoral thesis into an IRB approved (by Wright State University and The Federal Government) research study with 138 participants. Following the research, he was an invited speaker at the American Academy of Audiology, Joint Defense Veteran’s Audiology, and American Speech Language and Hearing national conferences. Additionally, he holds a motion picture copyright, 3 trademarks, 1 issued patent and 1 pending patent. In 2014 he started an audiology private practice in Dayton, OH. He is a business owner devoted to provide exceptional medical care continues to explore ways to prevent hearing loss and tinnitus. Dr. Smith started hypothesizing better ways to get people to wear earplugs after learning the United States government pays over $2 billion in disability benefits for acoustic trauma (tinnitus and hearing loss) and that the number of claims increases over 150 thousand per year.

He also learned hearing aid manufacturers spend hundreds of millions of dollars per year developing hearing aids because there is no cure for hearing loss. Therefore, instead of creating another coping device, Dr. Smith was determined to reduce hearing loss. In 2011 he started building HPD prototypes, sound chambers for testing, and investigated existing HPD patent applications. After writing his initial patent application, he appointed Dinsmore and Schohl, LLP for the completion of his patent application.

His patent issued and his company won the University of Business Plan Competition.:::1682:::254:::0.10277777777777779:::0.17430555555555557:::2:::19:::2015|||"

I like to work in multimedia such as digital paint, where I can use various tools and patterns to development my tea personality designs for Kickstarter. I have only been working digitally for a while and have not extended my project in various styles of media such as traditional paper and pencil. My style can vary on occasions, depending on the project and how I want to approach it in the most interesting way. This includes key research, development and study. I have done projects in the past and I have some interest in the client one to one business. This involves reading a client’s brief and asking questions on a regular basis to understand what they are looking for at the end product.

PSDSP combines a heavy aesthetic with melodious, spacey vocals, surprising lyrics, and virtuosic musicianship for a sound that picks up where Soundgarden left off, taking it toward where Alice Coltrane was going. Singer/guitarist Eli Carlton-Pearson first conceived of the band after reading the comically verbose official title of the Golden Gate Bridge's suicide barrier. Well aware that music had provided him and many others with a reason to live in otherwise hopeless times, he decided to name his band after the barrier, in a move that was both tongue-in-cheek and dead serious. Joined by Brian Wilkerson on bass and Michael Pinkham on drums the band has become a favorite in their native Bay Area, and continues to surprise audiences anywhere they go with reckless precision.:::875:::140:::0.1641212121212121:::0.4634603174603174:::2:::0:::2018|||"

"39911992:::348438791:::Michael Colvin:::I like to explore a chosen project through constructed imagery. This entails making props and re-photographing them to incorporate into visual narratives. I'm all about the narrative. I take a topic that I've researched and spend quite a bit of time thinking about it before I ever make any work. Sometimes all that thinking gives me sleepless nights and I reach across to make small doodles in my sketchbook that are visualisations of a thought that has been quietly nagging away at me. It can take a month or a few years for a project to get underway. Most of my projects are connected to Queer identity as that is part of who I am and I think it is important to make work on themes that I have a tangible connection to.

At some point the research has been done to death and there is a flurry of activity; prop making, scouting out locations, perusing my sketchbook for oblique truths – always thinking, always looking for that elusive moment when thoughts and ideas and visualisations crash together and something small coalesces into something larger, more profound. Once I know I'm there I find the work comes together very quickly and a series of images are made. They might need tweaking; that one idea that completes the series may remain ellusive for a while - but it doesn't take long once I'm fired up on a project.:::1329:::241:::0.05916666666666666:::0.2866666666666667:::1:::0:::2019|||"

Deduction Card Game, VERTIUM: Shadows of the Complex (SciFi), SHOOTERZ Hockey Card Game, STRIKERZ Soccer Card Game, WORDOPOLIS, and the author of Gold & Sharpe (a novella inspired by Get Adler!). I grew up in beautiful Cape Breton, Nova Scotia. Looking back on my childhood, I can remember inventing games.
At around 9 and 10 years of age, I used to sit down outside and show hockey cards to my beloved dog Spotty. I also made mini baseball games in the dirt with sticks and small pebbles. And best of all, I used to cut out those same hockey cards and play hockey at the kitchen table, with a silver ball for the puck: the foil from my mother's cigarette package.

Fast forward to the late 90's, I got an eye injury at work, which made me photophobic. I couldn't take bright lights and had to wear sunglasses all the time outside. I couldn't watch TV and I couldn't work on computers. The kids and I seemed to go back in time, and we spent many evenings reading, listening to the radio and playing games. Much to my surprise, I began to invent games again ...

I have had lots of help through the years, and I thank God for each person and each invention. I hope you will enjoy the games we bring here. Caper Games - bringing games to life! Enjoy! Randall:::1336:::250:::0.13415637860082305:::0.27132201646090537:::24:::43:::2015|||"

Back in 1999 Mike design and developed CertificateCreator.com as a way to gauge the potential for Flash (Macromedia Flash version 3 at the time) as a side project. The early version of the site was a success with upwards of 100K prints being made per month. In 2002 we launched version 2.0 of CertificateCreator.com as one of the first “cloud” based applications when we announced our innovative licensing by allowing users to be tied to their license and not have the license tied to 1 computer. In essence our license allows users to log in and work on their certificates from any computer and their saved certificates are saved back to the Certificate Creator database, “the cloud”. Over the years we have done client work for Apple Inc, the US Navy, Jim Henson Studio, Keller Williams Realty International and many others.:::915:::161:::0.14305555555555557:::0.25:::1:::0:::2019|||"

I have a group and music creation tribe called MOrganisation, was once part of the cosmic British band ELO, and I’ve authored a book called Patterns in the Chaos. My first album MORGAN was produced by Lou Reizner and issued on the Ampex label in 1971 while I was touring America as a folk singer. Back home my songs were recorded by groups such as THE MOVE, (‘Something’ was the B-side of the number one hit ‘Blackberry Way’). I had a top ten Pan-European hit with the song titled ‘Hiroshima’ (sung by Sandra) and as a musician I worked extensively with Richard Tandy, ELO’s keyboard player, most notably creating the concept album EARTH RISE, due to be showcased at a Birmingham Conservatoire Orchestral concert this fall. From 1981 to 1986 I was part of the ELECTRIC LIGHT ORCHESTRA (guitar, synth, vocoder + back-up vocals). I am credited on ELO's album SECRET MESSAGES and also on Jeff Lynne's ARMCHAIR THEATRE solo album, released in 1990. In the late 80s Richard Tandy and I teamed up with guitarist Martin Smith (ELOs bass player in 1986) to produce the compilation CD BC COLLECTION, plus the charity single ACTION produced by Jeff Lynne.

I see myself as a people pleaser, in that I love what I do for the times when people see my work and It brings them joy. There’s nothing more satisfying than witnessing people watching your animation and seeing them laughing and interacting with it. My goal is always to get people emotionally involved with my characters, whether that emotion be love, hate or any other feeling. I see that as a success.

While living there he went to Roosevelt; a Milwaukee charter school that specializes in the arts. In his teens he moved to the Fox Cities where he worked several mid-level management jobs throughout his much of his twenties. When he was 28 he quit his job to pursue his life's dream of being a professional artist. Since then Watkins has spent his time painting, drawing, writing lyrics for a rock band, designing games andother game products, and performing his ""action art"" at schools. Cosmo has gained attention for his radical style of spray paint painting from the media. He can often be found on State Street painting for large crowds of passer-bys on most summer Saturdays. He says that the people inspire him to paint and that it is their energy that drives him. In 2007 Andy Watkins founded Cosmo-Joe Entertainment; a company dedicated to the promotion of artists and arts. In 2014 he opened Studio 6d6, a workshop and gallery for creative projects. Most of Studio 6d6's 2000 square feet are dedicated to creating designer game tables. Studio 6d6 has also produced several unique dice designs and is working on several tabletop games.

In 2016 Studio 6d6 moved to a 8,700 sq ft building in Menasha WI where we continue to make great game tables and custom game products. Our new location has allowed us to work on our biggest project ever: RPEX a full scale dungeon RPG for conventions.

I love characters that are designed in such a way that you can read into their possible personality, behaviour and the world they live in, just from their design alone. The characters I create are heavily exaggerated in terms of both their design and expression, and my art style is incredibly cartoonish in addition to this.

I’m most comfortable with digital art, and, although I wish to pursue illustration more closely, I combine elements of what I’ve learnt about animation into my illustrative work, both in terms of design and even animating some comic panels. In addition to illustration, I’m also greatly interested in creative writing. I wished to pursue English in some way when I was younger, however realised that I could combine this with my love of drawing. Narratives and world building are incredibly important to me, and so my work focuses greatly on allowing people to glimpse into fantastical worlds that I’ve created. I love creating work that pops, so rather than focusing on intricate shading, I use strong black outlines contrasted by bold colours, with a single colour to shade: this creates the cartoonish look that my work possesses. I’ve worked on a few paid projects before, for example artwork for Beaconing, an educational game aimed at students, which taught me a great deal about working on professional briefs. I was able to create several storyboards, pieces of concept art and full illustrations, all on tight deadlines; I took part in this from summer of last year up until the end of my last semester.

I want to be able to gain even further experience and skills to use for my pursuit of being involved in comic book production, and I’m continuously studying core aspects and fundamentals of illustration to improve my work even further. I’ve worked on several short comics, both for my coursework and for personal work, and want to push my work further by creating longer comics with more complex stories. Creating longer comics would allow me to create more fleshed out worlds and to develop the characters that I’ve designed even further. Being able to dedicate a large portion of my time towards a longer comic, as part of my course, has been a great experience, and I wish to continue to work on a larger project such as this over the summer, whether that be on ‘Platform No.7’ or an entirely new project.:::2871:::511:::0.22621015072695744:::0.5055187226405714:::1:::1:::2019|||"

"1476742797:::1118646348:::Teal Blake:::Teal Blake is a nationally acclaimed Western artist who was made part of the Cowboy Artists of America in 2014. His primary medium is watercolor, and he has also successfully ventured into oil painting and sculpture.
Teal grew up in Montana, on the eastern slope of the Rocky Mountains surrounded by ranching country. He often had a rope in hand, looking for new adventures. Prior to beginning his career as a full time artist, Teal competed in rodeos, showed cutting horses and worked for ranches. Even today, he occasionally works as a cowboy on many of the country’s largest operating ranches, doubling as an artist to capture fresh subject matter for his work.
He is a second-generation artist and honed his skills inside his father, Buckeye Blake’s studio. From a young age, Teal was captivated by C. M. Russell paintings and was often found reading Will James books. The experiences became a natural force for prompting Teal to pick up a pencil and capture his own visions of cowboys and the American West.
Because of his life experiences, Teal strives to convey details that make the traditional West: cowboys not always clean shaven, shirts not always creased and horses’ manes not always long. This is a concept he has worked to express in his story of Samuel CB.
Teal’s artwork has an avid following. It has been highlighted in numerous national publications, including Art of the West, Western Horseman, Art Collector and many more. He was awarded the prestigious Cowboy Artists of America Artist of the Year in 2016. He and his son Luca reside in Fort Worth, Texas.:::1581:::276:::0.12668350168350168:::0.3023863636363636:::1:::1:::2019|||"

"174264685:::1951806056:::Paul Freeman:::Having established himself at the pinnacle of his craft, not only as a photographer, but as a visual poet and artist, Paul Freeman’s gift is to find and unashamedly eulogize the spirit of a rugged, yet sensitive male beauty. From his compositions and lighting to the particular texture of his shoot locations, his collections set a unique and mesmerising tone of sophisticated rawness rarely achieved in books of the male nude.

Freeman grew up in Tasmania, the small southern island state of Australia. Upon attaining a degree in English Literature and History , he moved to Sydney to study and pursue acting, before taking up photography, learning his craft at the Australian Centre For Photography.

His nude portraits of men and women, sports stars and actors, began appearing in the prestigious Black And White Magazine and in their sister publications, Sport and Blue, and in the magazines’ Olympic books, The Sydney Dream (2000) and The Athens Dream (2004).

Freeman made his mark in fashion and advertising too, with campaigns for major fashion labels and brands, winning the top place in international awards, the Cannes Lions and the Clios.

The New York Times art critic Robert Hughes’ featured Paul’s work in his 2000 documentary series Australia: Beyond The Fatal Shore, and his work has been featured in Australian television documentaries. He took time out from photography to write the best-selling biography of Australian footballer Ian Roberts, ( Ian Roberts: Finding Out, published by Random House in 1997).

His first book of art nude portraits, Bondi Classic, was published to critical acclaim in 2003, and a best-selling series of three more Bondi books followed.

His 2011 and 2013 books Heroics and Heroics II are a neoclassical exploration of the nude male, and reference sculpture and painting in Western European art, from the Renaissance on. This series questions contemporary attitudes to the naked male in life and art by juxtaposing it with our collective artistic heritage.

In Freeman’s Outback series, ( 2008-2014) he utilises the Australian bush and its’ changing moods to explore his male aesthetic, and to style and weather his subjects. Each book shifts focus to a different element of the theme from Outback ( 2008) , Outback Currawong Creek (2009) , Outback Brumby (2010), and Outback Bushmen (2012) through to Outback Dusk, released in September 2014. His latest Larrikin series of books,( Larrikin, Larrikin Yakka, Larrikin Digs and Larrikin Lads), continues his photographic journey, with an array of enthralling and sensual art nude stories of men in gritty and evocative landscapes and interiors. This time it is that peculiarly Australian larrikin ideal of masculinity, which is as much about character and individuality , as it is physical prowess and confidence, that drives Freeman’s signature visual narratives of confidence and bravado, juxtaposed with unexpected gentleness and vulnerability.:::2958:::470:::0.05439207551707552:::0.3486864220435649:::3:::0:::2016|||"

"680053822:::1615875937:::Damian Starr:::Damian Starr’s day job is to serve as a bookkeeper for a large property management company. Bookkeeping is a very black and white (or black and red) profession which does not come with creative opportunity. So when a good friend with a strong artistic background (Peter Goffstein) enlisted his help with writing a graphic novel, Damian quickly got on board.

Damian has long been a fan of graphic novels and comic books. This interest started over 20 years ago – right around the time Superman was killed, and the birth of Image Comics shook the comic community. .

As Damian grew older, building his collection took a back seat to building his career and a family. Just before he was to be married to the love of his life, it became evident that Damian had an infatuation of another sort; one which caused harm to himself and those around him. He is an alcoholic. The journey through recovery presented Damian with a variety of new experiences. He learned to be a more useful person and to love deeper. He discovered the personal value in putting others first and paying it forward. The lessons learned in his life play a big role in the way Damian writes and what he enjoys reading. As a young man he was all in with the X-Men and other mutant titles. While he still enjoys them, Damian has found that he prefers a tale that explores real-life challenges (“I Kill Giants, “God Country”). This is also the type of story he wishes to tell. His hope is that his stories evoke a strong emotional response, and leave the reader looking inwards.:::1545:::280:::0.10833651642475173:::0.32961892029539086:::1:::38:::2018|||"
"149227034:::1680895750:::FunDaMental Games:::Hello, thank you for taking the time to check out my profile, hopefully that means that my project has caught your interest in some way, shape, or form. I am the manager and designer of FunDaMental Games, a new game design and production company I launched in May 2018 to begin a journey into professional development of one of my favorite hobbies.
I have been actively gaming for over 20 years amongst many different styles of games. MTG, DnD, MMORPGs online, and of course traditional tabletop boardgaming. I love where the tabletop game hobby has moved to over the past ten years and want to be a part of its continued evolution in the coming years.
If you take the time, and provide the funding, to support my projects I will do my best to provide fun, strategic, and memorable games for you and your gaming groups. I plan to stay actively involved in any KS project comments/discussions, as well as many social media outlets. I believe that player and backer feedback is critical to improving game mechanics and quality.
When I'm not working, or game designing my time is spent with my family. We love boardgames and hiking in the mountains.
I look forward to the discussions we have and the projects we help create together!

Blind Beggar Miniatures has now run over forty successful Kickstarter campaigns, beginning with the Blind Beggar Launch campaign, which saw the birth of the company in December 2015,
Since then the Blind Beggar has added regular releases to those initial ranges of Pulp, Old West and Cthulhu Mythos themed miniatures.

2016 saw the introduction of the 'Outlanders' sci-fi setting, a range of figures suitable for classic sci-fi gaming that also work perfectly well for the Post-Apocalypse and Steampunk genres.

2017 saw the first of the Android Collectives come off of the production line. There are now almost thirty models in the range already and more are planned.

All of these ranges will see expansion with future releases on a regular basis, with the main emphasis being the expansion of the Outlanders range, but new ranges are in the development stage.

I hope that you like at least some of them and fancy taking part in one or more future campaigns to expand the range.:::1042:::172:::0.21739847454133168:::0.4722373856302428:::53:::16:::2013|||"

A Manchester five-piece renowned for their catchy and heavy music detailing subject matter of the more lurid nature, such as genitalia, bodily functions, heavy drinking, and sexually active bears.
Perhaps preceded by their reputations of elaborate costumes, including an infamous mankini and a tutu, along with a list of inflatables, the stage show is certainly a sight to behold. FitC were also the winners of the Young Blood award in 2018, hosted by HRH Magazine.
Three albums, two EPs, two Christmas singles, and a whole lot of silliness, plus live credentials ranging from Bloodstock Festival, Hammerfest, HRH Metal, Amplified Festival, and Download, to support slots with the likes of Psychostick, Dog Fashion Disco, Lagerstein, Arnocorps, Green Jelly, and Kunt and the Gang, to providing a live backing band to the Chav comedian Devvo… It’s silly, it’s fun, and it keeps getting worse.

According to a consultant survey, a small company like Queen Games creates over 150 jobs across raw material, production of finished goods, printing, logistics, and retail occupations. We have received many international awards and recognition for our games including Thebes, Lancaster, Metro, Shogun, Show Manager, Thief of Baghdad, Aqua Romana, and Fresco. In 2003, we won the German game of the year award with Alhambra, which has now been produced in 30 languages and is distributed all over the world and in 2012 we won it for Kingdom Builder! With the help of the Kickstarter community, we are eager to introduce you to games from new and established designers. Additionally, with our new US operations, we hope to create new and exciting titles unlike any we have previously published that will appeal to North American fans! Your support on Kickstarter allows us to produce more high quality Queen Games than we could otherwise provide. Today, our product range covers a wide spectrum, from children's games all the way up to strategy games. Whether for two people or the whole family, we have a game for everyone!

All of us band members are students at Ella Music Education, a rock musicians program at Gotlands folkhögskola in Fårösund. The music education is for female and non-binary people only, with a purpose to make a more equal music industry. Gender related questions and feminism are issues that are concerned continuously during the education, and the program is the only one of its kind throughout the whole world. A big focus of the education is put on producing and putting together tours. As students we do everything ourselves, all the way from booking gigs, constructing budgets, working out sponsorships, sending out press memos and designing posters, to driving the mini bus, setting the stage and managing the sound technique. In the end of February this year we got the assignment to make our own music and put together a tour, and right now we are in the middle of the work with booking, planning and writing songs. Ella Music Education was founded in 2004, and has since the start educated a number of musicians not only from all over Sweden, but also from other countries such as the USA, Japan and Finland.:::1129:::194:::0.13979591836734698:::0.3987244897959184:::3:::0:::2016|||"

Als Enkeltochter der Innsbrucker Jazzlegende am Klavier, Artur Rogger, bekam ich schon früh Einblick in die Jazz Szene. Da ich mich für Instrumente sehr begeistere, lernte ich später auch noch Klarinette und Saxophon, um mit meinem Opa gemeinsam Musik zu machen. Mit 20 Jahren lernte ich den Boogie Pianisten Robert Roth kennen, und begann bei Ihm Unterricht zu nehmen. Der Boogie Woogie, vor allem als Tanz bekannt, hatte mich sofort in seinem Bann.

Boogie Woogie erweckt Leben und Lebenslust in jedem Menschen, hat viel Emotion und bringt Schwung in den Alltag. Ich besuchte jährlich das Robert Roth Boogie Festival und hatte dort Gelegenheit mit internationalen Stars der Musikszene gemeinsam zu spielen. Dort würde ich vom französischen Boogie Pianisten Jean-Paul Amouroux entdeckt und für einen Auftritt beim größten Boogie Festival Europas engagiert. Viele weitere Auftritte folgten. Auf vielen Festivals in Europa, als auch in der USA.

Auf Grund dieser tollen Erfahrungen beschloss ich im Jahre 2015 mein eigenes Boogie und Blues Festival in Tirol zu gründen und startete viele weitere Konzertreihen dieser Art.:::1264:::194:::0.0:::0.0:::1:::0:::2019|||"

"420370544:::1228726246:::Ryk E. Spoor:::Born in Omaha, Nebraska, I've lived in Nebraska, South Dakota, Georgia, New York State, and Pennsylvania at various times of my life. I learned to read long before I went to school and began devouring books as soon as that happened. As an effort-induced asthmatic I was often housebound as a kid, so I read more, and began writing my own stories or drawing them (badly) at the age of six or seven. A large amount of my reading was science and nature, from then until young adulthood; these days I read a lot of scientific and technical stuff as part of my work.

My love for grand-scale space opera, which ultimately led to the Arenaverse, began when my sixth-grade teacher handed me a battered, cigarette-burned copy of E.E. ""Doc"" Smith's _Second-Stage Lensmen_, and continued through the rest of Doc's work, the works of Jack Williamson and James Schmitz and Van Vogt and later of Vernor Vinge, Lee and Miller, and Bujold, as well as -- naturally -- through a certain little film called _Star Wars_.

Of course, I have a far more general love for science fiction and fantasy in nearly all its forms and I've read literally thousands of books in the genre. I'm also a very long-time roleplaying gamer (since 1977) and I've been an online geek for even longer (first email sent in 1976). Educationally I've gotten degrees in mathematics and science (AS), psychology (BA), and information science (MSIS), yielding a fairly eclectic mix of education from three separate colleges; I've worked as a burger slinger, cashier, bookseller, bank check reviewer, project manager and QA overseer, game design consultant, store shift manager, and now as a research and development coordinator, plus other jobs I'm sure I'm forgetting.

I began dating my wife Kathleen in 1990 and married her in 1996, though we'd known each other for a long time before that. We have four wonderful children, one poodle, and a number of chickens, and a large number of stuffed and action figure ponies, dragons, Z-Warriors, ninjas, and others.:::2020:::351:::0.14191533844942936:::0.46734946871310507:::2:::16:::2012|||"

"1771763814:::1601933627:::Ben Quniey:::Hi, my name is Benjamin Quiney, I currently have no online alias but I am to grow a greater online presence via this Kickstarter project.
I am a Second Year Student of Illustration and Animation at Coventry University. I was born and raised in Birmingham. For a long time I would consider myself a more traditional illustrator; using more traditional medians such as Pencil, Paint and Paper. But since starting University the development of my art style has progressed into more digital and new age media. At first I found the transition alien but now I understand the benefits and drawbacks of both medians and find it easy to transfer from one to the other. Thanks to my time at university I have discovered a variety of art movements that I wouldn't have been exposed to without the opportunities and the individuals I have worked with and communicated with at university. An example of this is my recent work and exploration into psychedelic median which captivated me as it heavily uses bold and vibrant colour something I find attractive and try to incorporate into my own artwork itself. Growing up my hobbies were a variety of media; videogames, films and graphic Novels. I draw most of my inspiration from the latter two. A huge turning point for me in my life was the transition Marvel made from comic panel to film frame. Bringing to life the powerful and captivating story tales from the page to the screen. Im glad Ive had the opportunity to watch this cinematic universe evolve and grow. As the story advances so does the technology, movement and the direction. Something I believe parallels my own work. The significance of how far technology has changed in the last 10 years reallly impacted how I perceived my artwork. Transforming a hobby into a potential career path. Thanks to the internet it is now easier than ever to connect with a much wider audience transforming a local market into an international economy. Learning about peoples experiences and stories similar to my own and have they've grown into success stories is a real motivation drive and was the point when I knew I could make it in the creative industry. My artwork has also had an international inspiration. Cartoons were something I adored as a child and were a fixation of mine for a very long time. And When I was first exposed to Eastern animation I was captivated. The similarities to Western animation made it feel rest-assuring. But the differences what kept my interested. The variation in colour, motion, music and technique.

Colour is the element within my artwork that evolved the most. For the longest time I considered a career in Draftsman work because I felt technically I was capable but creatively I was weak.
But from my exposure to all these different cultures and art forms I was able to develop into an illustrator and even picked up a keen interest in animation along the way.

My past body of work had a tendency to gravitate to more dark and negative themes; I believe this is a reflection and reaction that I felt towards the academic side of Art in my earlier years.
I used to describe Art GCSE and Art A-Level as “Tasks and check lists. You were filling a criteria rather than creating a piece”

It really throttled my drive and motivation. It wasnt until I pursued the subject at Foundation level that my passion was reignited. I attended a Foundation level course at Coventry university where I was properly taught the academic and economic nature of art. But also the creativity, the fun and the life of the subject as well.

Within my first year of University I was given the task to produce a Graphic Novel that featured no text. In an effort to push forward our capability to visual communicate a message. Something I have carried into my second year with my current project. Although this time it is more in-terms of metaphorical messages and symbolism. The element I liked the most about the Textless story project was that it was taking a simple idea and giving it some form of twist to see how the form reacts and changes, in this case removing text from a comic. I would compare it to a silent film (but you could argue that they replaced audio with live performance and text panels on the screen) A silent Storybook maybe a better definition.
Whilst my idea was to create a tale, where the foreground tells a tale that has little influence or impact compared to the overall arching story. This inst a completely unknown philosophy. Literature uses foreshadowing in a similar manner. Id argue I'm just trying to reintroduce something back into market to see how it reacts.
Another famous known example is concept of “Chekhov's Gun” which is originally where I got the idea from. “'Chekhov's Gun' is a concept that describes how every element of a story should contribute to the whole. It comes from Anton Chekhov's famous book writing advice: 'If in the first act you have hung a pistol on the wall, then in the following one it should be fired. “

Many clues and future story elements can be found lurking in the background of my current work “Masqueraded” the Graphic Novel I aim to complete with the help and backing of this campaign.
The other main element I took inspiration from is the alarming rate of “Fake News” in an age of 247 news and information, stories have a tendency to snowball and escalate without anyone realising and I feel it is an issue that needs to have more awareness raised about otherwise; before it gets more out of hand.:::5493:::976:::0.13431380127808698:::0.38194738934534844:::1:::0:::2019|||"

"2095049794:::88078369:::Hugh Levick:::Graduating cum laude from Yale University, and with an MFA from the Iowa Writer’s Workshop, Hugh Levick set off for Paris to write a novel. In Paris he returned to his musical beginnings and the saxophone, studying and playing with Anthony Braxton, Steve Lacy and the Chicago Art Ensemble, amongst others. Later in NYC he studied composition at Julliard with Stanley Wolfe and David Diamond, and privately with John Cage and Vinko Globokar.

During the 1980’s and 1990’s in both the US and France, Levick composed , directed and performed the music for over two dozen stage productions. Levick’s solo performance piece, KID COPY, for a musician and his pre-recorded video double, was produced by the EDAC of Poitiers, France and toured in both France and the US. It was performed in the Bing Theatre at LACMA where two concert readings of his chamber opera , THE EMBRACE OF REASONABLE TERROR, were also given.

For the Brooklyn Bridge Centennial Celebration Levick was awarded grants by the NEA and the NY State Council for the Arts to create the Imago Ensemble, a combination of live and video-taped musicians. He also received an Artist-in – Residence award from PASS in NYC, and was awarded a studio in the Cite International des Arts in Paris.

Levick has written the libretto and the music for an opera, BANG FOR THE BUCK, and has adapted Kafka’s first novel, AMERIKA, into an opera enitled THE MAN WHO DISAPPEARED. NOSOTROS- a violin solo with electronics— was premiered by Davis Brooks in 2006, and will be included on Brooks’ CD of pieces mixing electronics and the violin.

In April, 2010, Ben Perrone’s On Going War Installation opened at the Burchfield-Penney Museum in Buffalo NY using WMD—WAR MAKES DEAD—Levick’s cello solo as an integral element. Also in April, 2010, the world premier of Levick’s string quartet, MORNING EVENING LOVE BEARS ALL, was performed by the Denali String Quartet in Los Angeles.
In May, 2011, HEAR NOW…A Festival of New Music by Contemporary Los Angeles Composers, created by Levick and attended by SRO audiences, took place in Venice, CA. In 2012 Signature Records, the dynamic and eclectic label sponsored by Radio France Musique will produce and record the DIOTIMA STRING QUARTET playing Levick’s three string quartets: MORNING EVENING LOVE BEARS ALL, EMPIRE Inc., and THE UNIMAGINED: PREPARATIONS FOR THE UNKNOWN.

We weren’t sure what we wanted to publish exactly, so like the happy panbibliophiles that we are, we opened our submissions, with no other personal guideline than finding a Canadian book we would fall in love with enough that we would want to publish and sell.

Five years later, this is still very true; however, we’ve also noticed an interesting trend in what we tended to publish. It turns out that we are naturally drawn to the voices of those who are members of a marginalized group (people with disabilities, LGBTQIAPP2+ people, people of colour), and these are the voices we want to continue to uplift.:::788:::145:::0.2800297619047619:::0.45186507936507936:::5:::40:::2014|||"

"2087110915:::703794557:::Stephen Moore:::I have been a graphic designer for longer than I care to remember and dare to admit, working and living for most of that time in London. At least part every working day during that period has been spent on a Mac using a whole host of different software.
I have had the pleasure (usually) of working with a range of clients but recently I have been increasingly drawn toward the truly astonishing possibilities that animation software now presents to creative people.
During any creative process, the creative has to be, well… ummm… creative. In addition to that, I have always felt equally drawn towards, ‘how stuff is done’, learning new software and combining new knowledge with existing. I think I’ve always had nagging doubts that this, to an extent, might be a weakness, it’s certainly lead me never to develop a ‘style’ for any length of time like a good many of my contemporaries. I’ve always wanted to move on and try different approaches.
Art is, I think, divided in two, applied and fine. When working to a brief, designers are the former, i.e. customers ask the questions and designers provide the answers. However, the fine artist lurks in most if not all of us but conventional work practices make that very difficult to express.
That was before crowdfunding for creatives, a brilliant opportunity for us to scratch that itch, for us to create AND fund a project that would otherwise be impossible. It is a superlative opportunity that I intend to explore fully and should I reach my funding goal, will put my heart and soul into delivering the best film possible.:::1581:::284:::0.19339410589410588:::0.5307276057276058:::1:::0:::2019|||"

"1689216619:::1784780603:::Alexis Wedgeworth:::Firstly, I am home schooling my four children. I have been homeschooling for 7 years and it has blown my mind how many people I have met who are ex-teachers whom now homeschool. There are HEAPS! Which should be a clue to some of you parents out there, that something is amiss in the public arena. Unschooling my kids allows me to follow what I know to be true about human development, good mental health practices, and childhood in general. The things I’ve learned about motivation are not being fostered in public schools. Things are being taught to children when it is not developmentally appropriate. I realize schools aren’t the same as corporate businesses but the system has been around so long and it’s still a mess, no clear direction, no clear purpose, and by it’s own standards it’s failing. Thus, the idea for an 18 month Untold Black History calendar as a tool that garners self cultural acceptance and promotions of absolute Black Excellence and Achievements infused in our everyday classroom experience. Knowing ones history moves a people forward. And it is my belief that, Seeing is believing! Let me ask? Would you feed your cat a steady diet of dog food?

"2126740727:::2128400350:::Samantha:::Formally, to everyone who meets me in life I’m Samantha Humphreys or Sammie. I live my days as a freelance illustrator and as an aspiring animator. Born and raised in the southern British seas, of a little seaside town in the county of Sussex, I spent most of my childhood hunting the area for any ounce of creativity within only to be drastically let down and forced to head straight to the world phenomenon oasis known as the internet.

Taking the plunge, unfortunately, had several consequences; mostly for my mother. The internet is a vast place, and thus it was inevitable I would discover the now mainstream Japanese arts of storytelling, manga and anime. At the time when I was discovering manga and anime, Japanese culture wasn’t popularized in the west, l became fascinated by the modern technologies and software being used to create such stunning 2D shows that were able to transport to me another world. On researching and thus discovering at a young age the magic of a graphics tablet and have been self-taught in digital art ever since incorporating wherever I could within my education. This discovery in my childhood soon led me down to my love of animation. I come from a loving but what maybe be considered ‘complex’ childhood, animation allowed me to find escapism in being lost in the fantastical world of animation and video games.

Due to the face there weren’t any other children my age experiencing what I was going through at the time, this sort of” dramatic” lifestyle, which meant I didn’t really have anyone to relate to meant I essentially relied heavily on animation, to escape the real world, being empowered by these fictional characters that were actually experiencing dramatic events happening to them, just like myself. What motivates me to do my work is essentially the concept of never being able to draw again. My life hasn’t been easy, but drawing has always been there in my crazy changing life. Life has always made sure I had drawing to go to when I been faced with challenges, and that’s when my drawing improves, to be honest.

I have throughout myself been raised and inspired by stories, ones that are so over imaginative its almost impossible to work out the logic of there existence, to the stories that are so real and raw that you almost feel that there’s no way this is simply fiction. I always knew I wanted to help people find escapism within animation but also be able to teach raw life lessons to help raise awareness to subjects I feel the world should know about. My best projects so far, such as Alistair Ghost: Defender of Man, and An Irish Twin, have been influenced by people around me and events that have occurred in my life. Bringing such subjects matters into a visual form, for an audience to relate to and connect with personally, is what I plan to do for the rest of my long-lasting days just as animation did for my nine-year-old geeky introverted self all those years ago.

Okay, that was a bit dramatic, I’m only 19.:::2995:::544:::0.10728624085105566:::0.5098422119718415:::1:::0:::2019|||"

"150522358:::1196946090:::dan smith:::So you want to know a little somethin’ about Dan Smith aka SMIF, huh?


Usually you have to become a member of the SMIF KIDS OF AMERICA CLUB, ($5.95 in most states) but since I like you, you get the FREE tour!

First let’s start with my moniker SMIF. My Name is Dan Smith (look it up online, you’ll see that we're all there, but I am the ONE, TRUE and ONLY DAN SMITH) and with a name like that, it’s hard to know if you’ve found the real deal. You know it’s the REAL DEAL DAN SMITH because I affect a Cockney accent when writing my last name and voila’–SMIF!

I am an illustrator, card game designer, graphic designer, storyboard artist, comic book creator and cad about town. (Maybe about YOUR town!)

What have I done, you ask? Well, such fancy “TOP DRAWER” Clientele ( here comes the “list”) such as: YAHOO, LIP SERVICE, ANHEUSER-BUSCH, WALMART, SPINMASTER, HASBRO, FOX INTERACTIVE/VIVENDI UNIVERSAL, SABAN ENTERTAINMENT, THQ/MASS MEDIA, MADONNA (YES, THAT ONE–FOR THE HARD CANDY TOUR), PACIFIC PLAY TENTS, STEVE JACKSON GAMES, WHITE WOLF GAMES, BOMP RECORDS…and many more.

People all over the world have enjoyed SMIF! (Some have even told me so.)

Little known SMIF fact #17: I know almost everything not worth knowing. Trivia master for my age range. I have no idea what knucklehead band is topping the charts today... that's your problem.

What types of things “turn me on” artistically? Alright, alright, since I asked…Pin up art, comic art, advertising art, art art, Art Fleming, the list is just too large! Pop culture a go go!!

Little known SMIF fact #28: I have a collection of 110 (that is not a typo) different versions of the theme to Peter Gunn. (Sorry if you couldn’t find any copies, I didn’t mean any harm.) And if you haven't seen the tv show, every episode is like a mini movie, it's so good.

Side collections include to “Cast your fate to the wind”, ""Mr. Lucky"" and “Jesus Christ Superstar”. (Oh the JCS collection is boss!!!)

I have Kickstarted successfully the KING of CRIME card game, BATTLE OF THE BANDS card game, FIVE MINUTE FIGHT:MONSTER card game, and am the kingpin behind the DUNGEON COMMUNITY SERIES of OSR book(s)... so I have had experience with this sort of thing. (If you are interested in those games, let me know. I have a couple left. And I do mean only a couple, they sold out, fast...)

"701120947:::892953666:::Saskia Griffiths - Moore:::SASKIA has always been involved with charitable community work. Before going into music full time she ran a private therapy practice in Harley Street, London for a number of years, volunteered at a drugs and addictions rehabilitation centre, and taught the anti-bullying programme: Massage In Schools, as a Freelancer. She has en extremely limited formal education - never having believed that qualifications are necessary to be successful in any field. In late 2014 she closed her business to follow her 'path with heart', and has been singing ever since.

The most remarkable thing about Saskia's career is that it has been 100% crowdfunded. After closing her businesses she had absolutely nothing, and relied entirely on her audience to support her. Which they did, overwhelmingly. She has run five kickstarter campaigns, and recently received her third substantial grant from the Arts Council England, allowing her to tour her debut album across the UK, which won her placements on national BBC radio, and got her music videos played on SKY TV 6 times in the last 2 years.

Though touring internationally, she remains an independent artist living in London which fulfills her need for culture but not nature, and currently flaunts two guitar endorsements from JWC Guitars and Agnew Instruments.:::1302:::208:::0.22513227513227513:::0.5531305114638447:::6:::4:::2014|||"
"252878206:::1382632387:::Joshua Mahan:::Hello! I’m Joshua Mahan and I’m and artist/illustrator based in the UK. A lot of my artwork draws inspiration from nature, from a delicate flower to vast landscapes experiencing the natural world has always been a calming experience for me. Awards season is also a big inspiration for my work; when it comes around I like to illustrate my favourite red carpet looks! At A level I studied biology, art, and film studies, and I’m currently taking Fine Art and illustration at university. I love films (especially animations) and the emotion they can provoke, so Pixar’s films are a clear favourite of mine. The wonder a film can create has always captured me, they can take you to magical, awe-inspiring worlds (however brief it may be).

Growing up I pretty much always experienced anxiety in some way; meeting new people, having to ask questions, or being asked to talk in front of a class, so over the years I’ve learnt, or been taught, different ways to cope with it and not go into full a blown panic. For me, a lot of the time a quick fix is to just breath, but when anxiety builds up sometimes I just need to get away; give myself room to think and gather my thoughts so I can come back with a level head (and normal heart rate).:::1236:::235:::0.11579685746352414:::0.39946689113355777:::1:::1:::2019|||"

So I invented the Quick Draw Straw and the Teazzed To Go technique to satisfy my craving for instantly brewed loose leaf tea. I had tried instant teas before but I just wasn't satisfied with the taste. With the Teazzed To Go technique, you get that freshly brewed tea flavor in as little as 30 seconds. Teazzed is my first company but I work with a great crew and feel confident you will love the convenience of the Quick Draw Straw and help get Teazzed off the ground.

"1694866955:::764373815:::Leslie Mendelson:::Acclaimed singer/songwriter Leslie Mendelson is completing her third full length studio album, ‘If You Can’t Say Anything Nice...’ The collection was recorded this past winter at Restoration Sound in Brooklyn, NY and is largely inspired by John Lennon's 'Plastic Ono Band.' “I listened to nothing but this album for an entire month and it made me fall in love with music again.” says Leslie. Where her previous work more closely dealt with matters of the heart, this time Leslie and her longtime writing partner Steve McEwan examine anxiety stemming from the current social climate with songs like ""Medication,"" ""I Need Something To Care About"" and ""Would You Give Up Your Gun."" 'If You Can't Say Anything Nice...' follows Leslie's 2017 release ‘Love & Murder.' Glide Magazine declared it, “one of the best records of the year.” All Music called it a ""poignant return."" It had been eight years prior when Leslie's Grammy Award-nominated debut album, 'Swan Feathers' was released. 'Love & Murder' features a duet with The Grateful Dead’s Bob Weir on Roy Orbison's standard, “Blue Bayou,” as well as haunting originals like “Jericho” and “Chasing The Thrill.” 'Love & Murder' led to two US tours opening for Roger Daltrey. During this same period, Leslie was asked to write and record a duet with Jackson Browne for a documentary due out later this year.:::1352:::243:::0.2174330357142857:::0.37486607142857137:::1:::2:::2010|||"

When Spider Perry's daughter Cat wanted a sturdy, cute transgender Pride yarmulke, the mother/daughter pair scoured the internet and came up dry. Spider took matters into their own hands - literally - and developed the first of NerdyKeppie's products. In the two and a half years since they sold their first yarmulke, NerdyKeppie has expanded to include Spider's spouse Steve. Their shop now centers not just around Spider's knitting needles but includes two embroidery machines and an industrial sewing machine, and their offerings have grown to nearly a thousand items: patches, t-shirts, swimsuits and activewear. Many of those items are made in their home-based studio in Pennsylvania - studio might be generous, it's half their bedroom and most of their dining room - and what they can't physically produce is outsourced to a US-based network of manufacturers. The core of the company remains ""two adults, three machines, three dogs and a teenager,"" a tight-knit structure that allows them to stay close to the LGBTQ community, their main focus.

Comparing to traditional fine art painters and industrial concept artists, I always find myself favour to stand in between of both. I am passionate in drawing and painting, because I love practicing these illustration techniques and appreciated the flexibility of imaginations. I loved the fact that I can try to explain how things are possible by illustrating precisely on my concept idea. In the future, I will like to become a professional concept artist in the industry.

"1007841221:::1367443623:::Roger Johnson:::Listening to Stag Cotillion, Volumes One & Two, it’s easy to see why Roger Johnson is a four-time winner of ASCAP’s PLUS Award and has nearly sixty songs registered with that PRO. With Stag Cotillion, he crafted an album that Beat Surrender called…

“a wonderful surprise – it’s a brave effort to release something of this breadth. Does it work? In a word, yes! Johnson is possessed of a wonderfully rich and layered voice. Add to the mix, his excellent song writing, a choice set of musicians and control over production – the end result is one great recording!""

Coming of age under the musical influence of the Beatles, Byrds, Flying Burrito Bros and Eagles, Johnson’s songwriting reflects a highly sophisticated take on life and affairs of the heart. By subtly altering his voice from one song to another, Roger also underscores the unique story within each of his compositions. His songwriting has been favorably compared to that of Rodney Crowell, Jackson Browne, J.D. Souther, Gram Parsons and Gene Clark. All influences aside, however, there's no question that Johnson’s music is fresh and distinctively his own.

Johnson’s vocals have moved John Gjaltema of AltCountry, the Netherlands to praise him as “a great singer with a beautiful, rich voice – similar to the western soul of Raul Malo."" Ingrid Michaelson's manager (and Secret Road music supervisor) Lynn Grossman agrees, saying that “Roger has quite a bit of talent – his voice is special and the songs are really good stuff!” Record producer and Juilliard School faculty member, Greg Knowles, summarizes Stag Cotillion as a “must have.”

Roger’s song, “Airstream” was used on the HGTV series “House Hunters” and among his career highlights was an invitation from venerable Los Angeles music producer, Nik Venet, to appear at his legendary “Campfire Conspiracy Songwriters Showcase.” Johnson has shared the stage with Americana artists such as Joe Ely, Kim Richey, SHEL and Rosie Flores. In addition, Roger has made multiple appearances at the annual Cosmic American Music Festival in Joshua Tree, California, performing alongside the likes of Adam Durwitz of Counting Crows and David Lowry of Cracker. Johnson has logged hundreds of hours in studios from L. A. to Minneapolis, absorbing the nuances of what makes a recording great. In 2009, Minneapolis-St Paul’s iconic Indie record chain, Cheapo, featured Stag Cotillion as its ‘Album of the Month’ for September. Later that fall, readers of the music blog, Twang Nation, voted it the third best Americana recording of the year. Album tracks have received airplay on both terrestrial and internet radio stations throughout the U.S. and Europe. Roger’s songs have also been a success in the digital realm; having been streamed and downloaded on iTunes, Pandora, Spotify, Rhapsody, Google Music, Amazon and more.

Looking to the future, Upper Midwest listeners of KFAI-FM were recently treated to an in-studio interview, as well as to a preview performance of several songs from Johnson’s upcoming new release, Mod Americana. Now in post-production, Roger expects to have the new album ready for release in the summer of 2019.:::3152:::543:::0.2670557616986188:::0.41165790558647697:::2:::1:::2011|||"

I studied Art and design at College in Birmingham then Wales. In the 90's I shared an art Studio on King Street in Manchester, working as a freelance illustrator. During this time I worked as a portrait artist for Manchester United, and for prestigious clients such as The Royal Mail. Following my love of Scootering and the Mod way of life I developed my Quadrotina Collection. These are paintings of scooters at Iconic British destinations. After receiving a hand written note from Pete Townshend I had meetings with The Who's management which led to the Tina Who collection, and now Stinger. I have exhibited my paintings on Carnaby Street, which features in my book. I met Nicky Weller at the Cunard Building in Liverpool, in the first few days of her amazing Jam exhibition "" About The Young Idea"". Nicky and Den invited me to sell my artwork in the shop, where we had 14 weeks of fun. Nicky Weller. Collaborator. I live In London and have been in the music business since I was 21.

I have self published two books entitled ""Growing up with The Jam"" and ""Growing up with Punk"". We collaborated in two Jam exhibitions along with Den Davis called “About the Young Idea”. We launched the first exhibition at Somerset House in London then took a much larger version to The Cunard building in Liverpool. It was here that I first met Tina Freeman with her Quadwoof prints... dogs on scooters that I absolutely loved. Tina showed us her Stinger the Bell Bee story which I thought was brilliant. Here we are almost 3 years on about to self publish the book to celebrate 40 years of Quadrophenia. We hope you enjoy it as much as we do.

"1844886594:::1982563414:::UaN Shoes:::Hello, I'm Katherine, founder of UaN Shoes. I worked in consultancy for several years but left my hefty work commitments to become a full-time mum and dedicate my time to bringing up my family of 3 kids. Now that I have a lot more time on my hands I have decided to pursue entrepreneurship in the context of kids fashion which I have always had a passion for. Jordi, my husband and business partner has been a huge support and key in pursuing this project. His more than 20 years of experience in the service sector as CEO, entrepreneurship, passion and drive for new business ventures has been and will be a valuable asset in this project.

The idea of creating a neutral fitting shoe with no right or left foot distinction came about when our three year old daughter insisted she would wear her shoes on the wrong feet (as many kids do when they become more independent) no matter what I said. Chloe is a very determined kid and was happy about wearing her shoes on the wrong feet.

My first preoccupation and aim was to research into the subject as I don't come from a designer, shoemaking background. My research began in London and continued in Spain. I have built an amazing team along the way who has helped me bring this all together. Those who have collaborated in this project include experts from the field of podiatry who have validated my mum-invented product, experienced artisans, creative designers, and scientific professionals. I have sourced suppliers in Spain and the product development phase also took place in Spain. I have had the opportunity to work with one of the best shoemakers in the Alicante region which I am very grateful for and sustainable factories both in Spain and abroad. I am self funded and have spent my savings to get to where I am. UaN Shoes is now ready, all I need is the demand. We believe that with backers money we can get a ""kickstart"" in getting our product onto the market and gain some brand notoriety. We want to offer parents the experience of allowing which makes you feel good, enlightened and relieved! And for the kids it's all about fun, freedom and creativity.

Thank you,

Hola, soy Katherine, fundadora de UaN Shoes.

Trabajé en una consultoría durante varios años y luego como traductora a tiempo parcial, pero dejé mis compromisos de trabajo para dedicarme a la maternidad a tiempo completo. Ahora que dispongo de más tiempo, he decido emprender en el ámbito de la moda infantil que siempre me ha apasionado.

Jordi, mi marido y socio ha sido un gran apoyo y una pieza clave para llevar adelante este proyecto. Sus más de 20 años de experiencia empresarial dentro y fuera del sector de servicios como CEO, su pasión e impulso por nuevos proyectos empresariales le hace un activo valioso en este proyecto.

La idea de crear un zapato de horma neutra que no distingue entre el pie derecho ni izquierdo surgió cuando nuestra hija de tres años insistió en llevar sus zapatos en los pies equivocados (como hacen muchos niños cuando son más autónomos) sin importarle el hecho de llevarlos mal sino el hecho de que ella lo hacía solita. Chloe es una niña muy decidida y era feliz llevando sus zapatos al revés. Esto me llevó a pensar que quizás se podía desarrollar un zapato que fuera atractivo y práctico para padres /cuidadores que experimentan lo mismo, además ¿por qué no hacerlo divertido para los niños? Y para los padres sería una alternativa desestresante, práctico y muy funcional.

Mi primera inquietud y objetivo era investigar sobre la materia, ya que no tengo experiencia en el mundo de la moda, ni tengo experiencia en la fabricación del calzado. Así que empecé la investigación en Londres y continué en España formando un equipo increíble por el camino que me ha ayudado hacer realidad este calzado. Quienes han colaborado en este proyecto incluyen expertos del campo de la podología que han validado el producto, artesanos experimentados, diseñadores creativos y numerosos científicos. Los proveedores son locales y la fase de desarrollo del producto también se llevó a cabo en España. He tenido la oportunidad de trabajar con uno de los mejores zapateros de la región de Alicante, por lo que estoy muy agradecida.

He autofinanciado esta primera fase del proyecto y he gastado mis ahorros para llegar a donde estoy. Los prototipos UaN Shoes ya están listos, y las fábricas están esperando producir nuestra primera colección, todo lo que necesito es llegar a las mínimas cantidades de producción. Creemos que con el dinero de nuestros patrocinadores podemos conseguir un ""empujón"" para llevar nuestro producto al mercado y obtener cierta notoriedad de marca. ¡Queremos ofrecer a los padres la experiencia de dar libertad a nuestros hijos y dejarles ser los protagonistas en sus aprendizajes, lo cual sin duda nos hará sentir a todos en definitivo más feliz y ligero! ¡A aparte de los niños sentirse más independientes!

"1421716661:::1301844685:::Thornwillow:::In 1985 Thornwillow Press was founded by Luke Ives Pontifell who spent his summer vacations from Harvard College printing and hand-binding books. What started as a labor of love has grown into one of the leading purveyors of fine books and custom stationery in the world, consolidating centuries of craft and technique in a complex of historic buildings in Newburgh, New York.

In subscribing to a Thornwillow publication, you not only add a beautiful and important volume to your library… you support the 20 designers, printers, and binders who have dedicated themselves to these arts.

Since its founding, the Press has published over 80 editions. We have been proud to publish original work by some of the world’s leading writers, poets, artists, political leaders, scholars, historians, and journalists — from William L. Shirer to Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr., from Walter Cronkite to Chief Justice Warren Burger, from James Merrill to Mark Strand, from Helmut Kohl to Barack Obama, from John Updike to Henry Louis Gates, Jr.

In 2015, the Thornwillow Institute was founded to promote and perpetuate the art of craftsmanship in all its forms, especially related to the written word. We believe that how we communicate and preserve ideas matters. Objects you can touch, keep, and give are central to the identity of our culture. These objects become the legacy of our society. They memorialize our values, triumphs, challenges, and dreams. The Thornwillow Institute is dedicated to passing down the arts and crafts of the written word which, increasingly, are endangered. We do this through partnerships with institutions and fellowships with individual artists, students, and makers.

The Thornwillow Makers Village in Newburgh, New York, is our campus. It is a complex of historic buildings with the press at its center and around which we are developing work studios, affordable housing, a gallery and event space, a market place, class rooms, a recording and video studio, and a community bookstore and cafe.

The Village supports programming from fellowships, internships, residencies, workshops, and jobs training to publications, concerts, performances, lectures, screenings and exhibitions. The Makers Village is a place to host programming and events that bring craft and culture to the community and is a platform from which to launch what gets created here to the world at large.

The Thornwillow Institute is a 501c3 Public Charity. Any pledges made ‘without reward’ are tax deductible to the fullest extent of the law.:::2544:::405:::0.051149991983325316:::0.27571749238415905:::29:::13:::2016|||"

"618451092:::161429855:::Sue M. Swank:::Sue M. Swank was born as an army brat in Washington, D.C. and grew up in Richmond, Virginia. For 10+ years she was a Victims Advocate in both New York and the Florida Keys (with one of her specialties being victims of sex crimes). She was certified and trained in profiling and trauma/crisis intervention.
After leaving her career, she took a sabbatical to regenerate herself. In 2001, she turned her hobby as a photographer into her second career, which flourished successfully. After several publications, she decided to narrow her photography into models and fine art.
During 2014, Sue took up writing and in 2015 self-published numerous books, including the ""Through Jade's Eyes"" novella series, since then she self-published several books. In November 2015, she began to shop around for a scriptwriter to help with her first book and was advised to learn how to write it herself. In December 2015, she began writing her first screenplay.

In 2017/2018, after suffering a massive loss with Hurricane Irma that destroyed her house, and open-heart surgery, she resumed her scriptwriting and pitched two of her latest scripts for filmmaking.
Currently, she has one script (drama) being optioned with an independent producer. It is her hope that one of her scripts turns into a film by late 2019.
Her inspiration comes from the world around her.
Her interests vary from photography to traveling and learning about different cultures. She feels that the world is best viewed through the eyes of a lens and the stroke of a pen.:::1532:::255:::0.1355723905723906:::0.3239141414141414:::1:::0:::2016|||"

She was discovered in 2010 in her hometown Johannesburg by international guest Ana Marie Forsythe at a Horton workshop, and recruited to the competitive Ailey School/Fordham University BFA program in New York City. At the time she trained intensively in modern concert dance under the instruction of Laraine Rabin. Ms. Mathebula was awarded an Emily Blavatnik/Ailey Artistic Scholarship, and a National Scholarship for Dance from CATHSSETA to attend the program. She graduated Cum Laude as a double major in Dance and Political Science, and went on to dance professionally with Alpha Omega Theatrical Dance Company. She has adjudicated 'Solo Performance' in Johannesburg, a prestigious modern dance examination and competition, and performed works by noteworthy choreographers including Ronald K. Brown, Matthew Rushing, Michael Leon Thomas and Vincent Mantsoe, as well as Alvin Ailey in his classic work Memoria at New York City Center Theater. As an emerging choreographer, Ms. Mathebula first created “Community Spirit” as a selected independent study artist at The Ailey School, then presented work in festivals around the city, before self-producing a show to launch MATHETA premiering “Keep Up” and “Keep On”. Since then, the Company has completed a CUNY Dance Initiative residency at Brooklyn College, where Khensani created her latest work “buya”; a meditation on absence - the abandonment people can experience in relationships and how they deal with the different feelings that ebb from it. MATHETA Dance keeps performing at curated festivals around the city - most notably having performed as a part of Movement Research at Judson Church. She is excited for the Company to keep growing and sharing movement that speaks to the hearts and minds of all people.:::1894:::301:::0.18972727272727274:::0.3901742424242424:::1:::0:::2017|||"

"348324556:::1327277088:::Dan Grubb:::Hi all,

I'm Dan Grubb, CEO of Fantastic Books Publishing and organiser of FantastiCon, our annual SciFi and Fantasy event.

I've been in the publishing business now since April 2012 and spent many years previously working as an author's agent. This gave me an insight into the world of publishing that few get to see.

This is why I set up Fantastic Books, to help authors get their work out to the world while ensuring that, for every book sale, we never make more that they do. This frees up their time to do what comes naturally, write Fantastic books!

I have loved books since I was tiny and I fell in love with science fiction when my Grandmother gave me a tattered copy of Ray Bradbury's 'Golden Apples of the Sun' when I was 8 years old. I never looked back. My favourite stuff is still the older works by the likes of Harry Harrison, Fred Saberhagen and, of course, Asimov. We've recently published a collection called 'Synthesis' which is an homage to these earlier collections.

Iain Banks writes incredible science fiction too and anything by Douglas Adams is guaranteed to have me rolling about with tears in my eyes. In fact, come to think of it, it was the Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy that first made me howl out loud on a crowded tube train. An acute but thoroughly bearable embarrassment caused entirely by the 'whale/bowl of petunias' scene for those of you who know the story.

I also love dark crime, romantic literary novels, epic fantasy and post apocalyptic disaster novels so quite the mix of genres really!

My wife Gabi and I have also released a series of cook books too. A collection of 50 old fashioned gravy and sauce recipes is our favourite and yes, you guessed it, it's called '50 Shades of Gravy'... apologies :)

For years now we have organised FantastiCon, an annual science fiction, gaming, cosplay and music event that celebrates all things geek in a relaxed, accommodating, welcoming and family friendly atmosphere.

Running FantastiCon made us consider a completely new division to the company, Fantastic Books Gaming. The division's inaugural game will be showcased at FantastiCon 2019. Watch this space!

Thanks for checking out my projects, it's great to meet you and I appreciate your support!

We are truly a family farm, the workforce of which consists of Maree and myself plus our three children; Sylvia (14), Willem (12), and Graham (9) with the support of extended family and nearby friends. We have operated a CSA in the area for the past 14 years, growing from 2 members in 2005 to over 100 today. We've also diversified our operation to support the health of the farm's soils and diversify our operations to include broilers, hogs, egg layers, sheep, and, most recently, a family milk cow - all on 20 acres. Many customers and locals will know our family from the Lakes Area Farmers Market in Detroit Lakes, where we've sold every Saturday for 13 years. We also host a self-serve farm stand at the end of our driveway. I learned the craft of vegetable farming through an apprenticeship in 2000-2001 on an organic CSA operation near the twin cities.

After moving to Houston and graduating from high school, she began working at a print shop in Jacinto City, TX. In 1991, Tonia began her corporate career, working in several industries such as mental health, real estate development/property management, software technology, Oil and Gas, and currently in community service. Based on her strong work ethic, she has been steadily promoted, starting from a clerk, she has served in positions as Executive Assistant, to project manager.

"1767260898:::1388918651:::Sarah with an H:::When the mind, body, and soul combine, the beautiful melodies of Sarah with an H can be heard whispering throughout Appalachian pines. Roots twist through travel, education, and years of performing to create a truly inspiring and lifting musical experience. With a broad range of influence including Eric Clapton, Bonobo, Alice Russell, and Jimi Hendrix, Sarah with an H’s music is not only soulful, but truly genre bending.

Sarah’s music is largely influenced by travel, education, performing, and growing up in Michigan, later moving to North Carolina. Her roots and heart span all of the places she’s lived and explored. This musical journey began when she was just 11, receiving her first guitar from her parents. Her lyrics are inspired by a deep spiritual connection to nature and to living in the southern Appalachian mountains. She sees the world through the lens of a healer in her work towards becoming a music therapist (she studied at Appalachian state), fascinated by human expression and the vulnerability that comes with creativity.

Sarah’s music is also shaped by her 12 years of experience performing both solo and with groups such as Urban Soil. After five years of touring with Urban Soil throughout the southeast at venues such as Floydfest, The Pour House, and Shakori Hills, Sarah has embarked on her solo career. She was an integral part of the two studio albums and one live album recorded with Urban Soil, earning recognition for her vocals, guitar work, and songwriting.:::1502:::254:::0.1505976977567887:::0.3581800144300144:::1:::1:::2017|||"

"999214729:::1042826160:::Mitch Foust:::As a kid growing up in the late 60’ and 70’s, I had a fascination with all things heroic. The Batman TV show, SpaceGhost and the Herculoids, and Disney’s Zorro are just some of the influences on my childhood. Then came comics! Wow, there were no words to describe the amazement I had with comic books. Nick Cardy, Jim Aparo, and John Buscema had a tremendous impact on my creative talents early on.
	Later, in high school, some friends introduced me to D&D. This was the game I had been looking for all of my life. A couple of years later, I found some Larry Elmore art on a D&D game. There, for the first time, I saw fantasy figures in a realistic setting! There were blue skies! Up until then, all fantasy paintings were either Frazetta or Boris clones. Here was fantasy with realism.
	My senior year in high school, I got a job airbrushing t-shirts in a local mall. It was the early eighties and airbrushed t-shirts were a big deal. While working this job, I made friends with several mall employees around the shop. When the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles hit big, everyone started doing black and white comics. I was no exception. I got together with a few of my mall friends and The Last Generation was born. It didn’t last long, but it introduced me to the world of creating artwork. I did some covers for other companies and got to meet my hero, Larry Elmore. If you can’t tell, he has had a huge influence on my work. I am currently working on an original graphic novel called Rogues of Larakesh. A few years ago, I completed a graphic novel on the life of King David for Shepard King Publishing. I found a lot of great reference for the project, but it was either the wrong place or the wrong time period. Rogues of Larakesh is a way for me to use that reference. I am financing the project myself. So it may take a while. You can find out more at roguesoflarakesh.com
	I am still a working artist. I travel around the south doing conventions and shows, selling prints and artwork. It is great to feed back from the public.
	I still live in my hometown of Memphis, TN. I live with my wife, Kathy. We have two grown children, Daniel and Katie.:::2154:::411:::0.04943449647995102:::0.2773905723905724:::6:::89:::2012|||"
"1811606418:::1481805695:::Inner Compass - Neel:::I believe that becoming the most authentic and effortless version of yourself starts with consciousness: to become aware of what serves you and what is holding you back.

Imagine the most active mind possible, worse than the monkey mind. More like hundreds of monkeys playing the smart ass card 24/7. That was me. It gave me major sleeping problems and a pretty tough life, at least for the first 30 years. Then, step-by-step, I discovered the possibilities of a more conscious lifestyle through mindfulness, yoga, meditation, therapy, plant medicines and much more.

I have been an entrepreneur for more than 10 years, during which I only started projects that I really liked. So it had never been work that knocked me down. Love, on the other hand, hit me twice. First time I had to let go off a dual soul. Some of you might know that feeling, like limbs are being amputated. The second time I ended up in a relationship that was based on ego rather than love. I tried to fill the void by following up on ego's image of a rich life and at the same time dissociation took place, as if I was separate from my body and looking at myself. I got panic attacks and stress hormones took over. My body would not fall asleep properly for almost a year. It took another two years to recover and yet I would not want to have missed this tough journey, as it was the biggest step into finding my true self. Moreover, in this period, the first seeds of the Inner Compass cards were planted. My life became so much easier by getting to know the wisdom of the universe. This wisdom that is available for all of us, but that we so often get distracted by the rat race of society.

I had always known I was going to inspire others, but for a long time I did not know how exactly. And now, together with a designer, an editor and a number cruncher, I am developing the Inner Compass deck. Two of my worlds come together. My former passion: design, and my current and biggest fascination: spirituality. I proudly share that I have found the right track, my yellow brick road, and I would like you to find yours too!:::2104:::388:::0.1338723544973545:::0.33714120370370376:::2:::7:::2015|||"

"317107547:::403861673:::Laura MacLeod:::I grew up in Dartmouth, right next to the Brightwood Golf Course fence. A stones throw Dartmouth High. Still managed to be late everyday…

My best friends growing up lived a couple blocks over, and are still my friends today. I had my beautiful daughter early in life which had me growing up pretty quickly. I went to school for interior design, while working retail at Mic Mac Mall and trying to figure out what the heck I was going to do. What I did was get married, have an equally dazzling son, and work as an interior designer for the next 22ish years. We moved all over the world for my husbands job. Our family lived in New Zealand, Germany and the US. All this time, I was gathering data for a business I didn’t know I wanted to own yet. The kids were off to university, Kate at NSCAD and Donald in culinary school. In October, 2013, while living in Germany, there was a big life change. I moved back to Canada on my own. A bit lost. A trusted advisor (my father-in-law) suggested that I too might enjoy culinary school. It seemed like as good a place as any to put my focus. I packed up a jeep and drove across Canada on my own, just me and the cat, in December. Readers, don’t do this in a Jeep TJ on your own….. in December. I started at the Pacific Institute of Culinary Arts in January of 2014, right after my son graduated from the same school. I had always cooked, and had assumed that was the road I would go down. And then I began the pastry arts portion of the program. It was love. The precise science of baking, coupled with decorating the finished pastry spoke to my perfectionist and artistic sides. Suddenly all of the bakeries I visited during my travels came rushing back. The vibe from a place in Charlotte, the variety of breads from a place in Heidelberg, the coffee shops in Auckland, the bakeries in Vancouver. I was going to open a bakery back home. I began planning even before graduation. I moved back on January 15, the next day there was a snow storm. Hours of talks with Kate and Donald (and Emily - his fiance) - we held all our pre-opening staff meetings at Stillwell. It was the winter of 2015. I’m not going to lie, I asked aloud many times why I moved back during that winter. Getting construction done on time with all those storms was a challenge but I had a great crew. We opened on Open City Day. And sold out. Kate and I were exhausted and thrilled. That’s how we spent most of the rest of the year. Many lessons have been learned. Some of them have been very hard. I still love to bake. That has been a joy in my life that I wouldn’t have found without a simple suggestion.:::2622:::506:::0.18161717911717914:::0.3428444703444703:::1:::0:::2019|||"

When i entered my early 20's I met some people that changed my views, I stopped believing i couldn't do something just because it seemed a little to far out of my reach or just an inch to far past my abilities.

I continue to try to learn and create something new everyday.

I hope we can all bring this art to life together.

"1903469585:::179115698:::The Dead Puppets Society:::Despite its name, the Dead Puppets Society has nothing at all to do with puppets (as of yet). Originally, the group came together due to their interest in writing scripts and theatre; typically into the oft-ignored arena of horror-theatre with projects such as the anthology series Tales from the Bottom of the Well, Frankenstein, and, with a nod to the almost unheard of genre of 80s slasher movie theatre, Black Jack 1 through 6. Over the years, however, the group has branched out to other literary avenues. Now it is a group of award-winning writers (as well as award-winning directors, actors, musicians, and all around cool people) who gather semi-regularly to work on various projects. Individually, they have had stories published in international literary magazines, journals, and anthologies. While each member of the DPS brings their own flavour, storytelling ability, and style to each piece they write, horror is perhaps the genre that they feel the most comfortable with. It is little surprise that The Hacker Inn is the first anthology that the group has produced exclusively on their own.:::1104:::180:::0.09999999999999999:::0.46694444444444444:::2:::0:::2017|||"

"2066895977:::12087264:::Jason Friend:::Based in Newcastle-Upon-Tyne in England’s North-East, Jason Friend is a professional travel and landscape photographer. For Jason, photography is more than a job; it is an opportunity to inspire. For over a decade, Jason Friend has devoted his life to combining his passion for photography with discovering the endless majesty of the natural world. From the rugged terrain of the Australian outback to the mountain summits of Switzerland, Jason has travelled the globe on a quest to immortalise nature’s most breathtaking moments. National Geographic, British Airways, Microsoft Corporation, Australian Geographic, Hasselblad and Rough Guides represent some of the many high-profile clients Jason has inspired and worked with along his journey.

Jason’s professional landscape photography is a dedication to our spiritual connections with the world around us. His photographs aim to convey the emotional experience of the landscape by extending beyond ‘pretty post-card’ visual appeal to engage and stimulate all the senses. Whether allowing us to taste the crisp, salty sea air from a surrounding beach, or feel the warm glow of sunrise peek out behind a rolling country hill, Jason’s landscape photography offers an enchanting escape route from the stress and distractions of our everyday lives, to an idyllic natural environment teeming with beauty and wonder. Jason’s venture into the world of nature and travel photography began with an image by landscape photography legend, Ansel Adams. Jason was captivated by the striking panoramas captured by many of Adams’ famous black and white images of the American West. Despite his early fascination with Adams’ work however, it was a trip to New Zealand in 1999 which inspired Jason to predominantly shoot in colour early on in his career. Immersed in the breath-taking landscapes of New Zealand, Jason learnt the powerful impact that temperamental light and weather conditions have upon the vulnerable environment below, and took this knowledge with him throughout his world travels and eventual foray into black and white photography.

For Jason, light is the master of his craft. His landscape photography is borne out of a deep respect towards mother nature’s ability to reveal the magnificence of her subjects in both illumination, and in darkness. Jason’s engaging images reflect a profound understanding of how light and shadow reign over nature, causing the landscape to transform with emotion. Motivated by the desire to bring the viewer closer to nature and convey this deeper insight, Jason skilfully captures his subjects in that crucial moment when form and texture is powerfully revealed through perfect light. Jason’s masterful approach to both colour and black and white landscape photography reveals nature’s most intimate moments to us, demonstrating his talent behind the lens, and his passion for the subjects within them.

“Time cannot be revisited; it changes everything in a split second. Whilst these moments can be spectacular, they can also herald more subtle changes. But one thing is for certain - this scene will never appear again. Fourteen years ago I left the UK on a quest to capture these fleeting moments. My role as a photographer is to convey these emotions, not by capturing an image but by sharing a vision….every trip spent behind the camera is special.”

Jason is available for photography workshops throughout Cumbria, Northumberland and Tyneside, and for commercial photography commissions throughout the UK. His stock photography images can be licensed via this site, and also his international agents which include Getty, Masterfile and Corbis.:::3648:::589:::0.15600272915490307:::0.4042361503231068:::11:::0:::2013|||"

"919049107:::733205892:::Munchkin Metropolis:::Hi there, I'm Roger Kolikas. I'm the owner of a small construction/woodworking company called Munchkin Metropolis, where I specialize in custom items for kids mostly, but I've gradually been growing in the gaming accessory industry. Fancy custom deck boxes are pretty neat and add a bit of flare to anyone's deck!

I never did care for talking about myself much, but since this is the only way you can get to know me for now, that's about it for the business side of me. I've linked all my pages so you can get a better feel for who I am as a person and the quality of work you can expect from me should you choose to back one of my projects.

On to the personal side of me. (I don't have one, I'm a mystery....if mysteries weren't mysterious)

I was born and raised down south in Mississippi. My earliest memories are of playing outside with a stick (Sword) and fighting a terrible beast (Pet hamster). We had recently moved to a piece of property that only had a well for water. No house, barn, building of any kind, we lived in a tent that first summer. We were to build our house during our first summer there. And we did! (Sort of...I mean, it was a single room with plywood floor and 3 walls, the 4th wall was just plastic stapled to the studs. But on that wall is where we had our wood burning stove/heater. (I've never been as warm in a house since, and we had 3ft of snow that first winter!) We had a 5 gallon bucket and a sheet hung up as a bathroom. But it worked, and I loved it! We had a 55 gallon drum mounted with a draining hose that had a shower head attached, so we could shower on warm days...cold days too, but I don't count that as a shower. It was more like scrub scrub scrub, fast fast fast, let me out!

As you can tell, I had an AMAZING CHILDHOOD! It was like camping all the time. Booyah!

I go my first job at the age of 8, as a gopher (Go for this, Go for that) on the construction site my grandma's husband worked at. It paid $2/day....and that was a lot for me back then. I could go to the $1 theater on Saturday, play arcades, get the LARGE popcorn/drink combo and watch movies all day long with my own money. (That's right, MY money)

I learned at a young age how to live broke, and I'm glad I did. That knowledge comes in handy whenever life tries to knock me down. I grew up proper and joined the Marines at 17. Stayed there a few years before coming home and starting my own company (Woodworking, right?....wrong!) Selling at a flea market. It was good money sometimes, bad money sometimes, but I was the boss (Of myself only, but still, it counts....right?) I worked the market and craft shows for a couple years before stumbling into a mom & pop Video store (Old school, still did VHS and only had like 7 DVDs at the time). I bought out the bin of VHS they had for sale (At a discount so I could resell them) and I left them my number in case they had more to sell later on. Business must have been bad, because not even a month later they called and asked me to offer a price on all the movies they had left. I did them one better and offered to buy the store as it sat. That store's name was Reel World. Little did I know that one decision would change my life forever. I took that store and turned it into the first DVD only store around (This was back in 1996).... It did well until not 1, but 2 large movie rental chains came to town. But, you know the drill (Improvise, Adapt, Overcome)....So, I made a switch and started carrying more games. More and more kids started hanging out at the store and eventually one of them requested I start carrying Magic the Gathering (In my mind, wth is that?) Fast forward a year and we are the only shop around running FNM and JSS events. I cut the DVD rentals down to a single shelf, the rest of the space was for couches, TVs and original Xbox systems (We had 16 and they stayed full with kids play 16 player Halo over the LAN). It was a great time to game!

{But wait, you said you've been woodworking your whole life, how'd you do that while you were doing all this other stuff?}

The answer? I never stopped, it just wasn't a business, it was a hobby I did for fun. I also picked up leathercrafting along the way, just fyi. Munchkin Metropolis is a company I originally started as a home improvement company that specialized in Children's playsets, playhouses, furniture (We did grown up things too)

Eventually I married and got talked into selling the shop.... 6 months later they had ran it into the ground and all the local kids had nowhere to go. Of course I had to reopen! They must have a place to go! Throughout the years I've had 7 renditions of Reel World Games (We added the ""Games"", but kept the name of the original shop). And just 3 years ago, I moved right back into the same building where I purchased Reel World 20 years ago. Life is funny sometimes. Now I get to do both, Reel World & Woodworking, in the same building (Different bays).

I don't make a killing, but I'm pretty happy most of the time (Except on Sunday, that's when we count the register)

Now you know my story, why not message me yours? I love listening to how other people have lived.:::5177:::1015:::0.1509833084394488:::0.4003405504501995:::21:::13:::2014|||"

Partiendo de un interés central por una poesía de renovación formal, y por presentar buenas traducciones, la editorial inició un nuevo período en el año 2010, creando cinco colecciones que abarcan importantes títulos para quien busque acercarse a la literatura contemporánea y la reflexión en torno al acto creativo: Poesía, Poesía [Nuevos], Ensayo, Biográficos y Cine. Desde el inicio del proyecto, se estableció un criterio claro partiendo de un interés central por la difusión de una poesía que no sólo se consideró fundamental en su propuesta formal, sino que había quedado al margen, trabajos que plantearan una renovación de la expresión poética tradicional, en México desde luego, pero además en el ámbito de nuestro idioma. MaNgOs de HaChA surgió a partir de una inquietud por producir buenas traducciones, un trabajo indispensable para ampliar las posibilidades expresivas de nuestro entorno.
La editorial está integrada por José Luis Bobadilla, Juan Carlos Cano, Ricardo Cázares, Jessica Díaz y Tatiana Lipkes.:::1169:::180:::0.08:::0.27999999999999997:::1:::2:::2015|||"

Undoubtedly inspired by these artists, a group of University of Michigan Arts Chorale members got together to have some a cappella fun. After much debate, the group adopted the name ""Gimble in the Wabe"" from Lewis Carroll's poem, Jabberwocky. Since then, the group name has transformed into Gimble A Cappella, and the group has evolved into the self-proclaimed quirkiest a cappella group on campus! Each year, Gimblers unite to choose and arrange all of their own a cappella arrangements. In addition to hosting three concerts a year and collaborating with incredible groups like Maize Mirchi and Gold Vibrations A Cappella, Gimble can be seen frequently performing at various events around campus as well as around the country on their annual spring tour. Early in 2017, Gimble released their debut EP, XX, featuring two of their most famous songs - I'm with You and If I Go - and topped off by the fan favorite Don't Wanna Be Your Girl. In February of 2018 Gimble dropped a new single, 715 - CRΣΣKS, and they released yet another single on April 6th of the same year, Dancing on my Own. Going strong in it's 22nd year, Gimble continues the tradition with a few fresh faces and a continued passion for a cappella music.:::1365:::240:::0.25160974827641497:::0.4164600368767036:::2:::0:::2018|||"

When we dug deep into the realms of neuropathy we realized that a method called active compression could be wonderful solution. That took us down the route of looking at active compression and the technologies we could use to achieve this. In our journey, the more we researched the more we realized that active compression could not only offer a solution for diabetic neuropathy but it had far more expansive therapeutic effects. It was something that could benefit tens of millions of people all over the world. Sadly, a lot of the active compression solutions that were out there were either very, very expensive or were used in hospital settings that were inaccessible for many people. We wanted to do it differently. We wanted to bring active compression to everyone out there. Hence, we created Spryng! Through Spryng, we want to bring the benefits of active compression in an easy to use and affordable manifestation to all of you! Our vision is to offer recovery and rejuvenation solutions which will help people all over the world elevate their sense of being!:::1175:::198:::0.04103535353535355:::0.44555555555555554:::1:::0:::2019|||"

"1255595644:::1499100677:::Simon Belshaw:::I have studied composition with Gavin Bryars, Andy Hugill and Philip Grange and gained a PhD from the University of Hertfordshire in 2005 for my research into Generative Systems and Disruptive Processes in Musical Composition.

I have had pieces performed by the Schidlof Quartet, PM Ensemble, Gemini and Double Image (amongst others) as well as providing music for video and television.

The Music Machines grew from my interest in generative music systems. Initially they were all stand alone computer programmes but I have recently developed some for live performance or specific events. For example, I adapted Music Machine 10 to be played at the Hilltown New Music Festival 2012, Music Machine 5 for the Audiograft Festival Jukebox 2013 and Music Machine 29 for Sonoroties Festival 2014.

The first 20 machines are computer programmes that can be downloaded from my website, all are available for Mac and Windows. Each Music Machine explores a single idea. Some are simple, some more complex. All are generated by the computer within established parameters, all run continuously until stopped by the listener and all are different each time they are played. Some involve interaction by the listener either to make choices from a number of parameters (for example Music Machines 6 and 9) or to press a button to “play’ along with a backing track (Music Machine 3), most require only to be listened to. The term Music Machine is a reference to John White’s Machine Music: The Machines, which date from the period 1967-1972 represent a departure from the more traditionally ""narrative"" nature of the rest of my pieces. I use the word Machine to define a consistent process governing a series of musical actions within a particular sound world and, by extension, the listener's perception thereof. One might thus regard the Welsh Rarebit as a Machine in which a process is applied to the conditioning and perception of the world of bread and cheese. My Music Machines share many similarities with the work of the English Experimental composers of the 1960s and 1970s. There is a connection with the American minimalists through the use of a steady pulse, repetition and tonality. Music Machine 2 for example could be entitled In C and Music Machine 4 will invariably involve glimpses of phasing. Most recently Music Machines have been developed for live performance. This began with a workshop and subsequent
live performance of Music Machine 1 at Exeter NonClassical in March 2013. This work has since been performed at the York Spring Festival 2013 and the Vibraphonic Festival 2014.:::2593:::429:::0.08800694919115971:::0.2584629186602871:::2:::4:::2013|||"

"478066327:::1064985038:::Sander Bakker - SplinterSeed:::The short version: In the foothills of the Sierra Nevada I design and make. Originally from Rotterdam, the Netherlands.

The longer version:
The least tangible area of design is where I had my start, having been educated as a sound designer for film and digital media (Dutch Film Academy, Amsterdam, The Netherlands). Slowly drifting away from this discipline, my focus shifted to interactive sound/photography installations alongside lighting design for the Dutch Royal Ballet.

It is this unique combination of interests and skills that drew me to London UK, where I worked at the renowned Tate Galleries in the pioneering department of Time-Based Media Conservation. I assisted in the development of conservation strategies for time-based art. The works of many multi-media artists in the collection of Tate Galleries, such as Bruce Nauman and Christian Marclay, have been affected by my input.

Working in an environment where sound, light and images collide in exhibition spaces ignited a dormant interest in architecture. I moved to Los Angeles to attend the Master of Architecture program at UCLA, where I was exposed to parametric and algorithmic design strategies. These approaches to design often result in very complex and ephemeral geometries. The transition of these forms from the digital domain into the physical world is often problematic. It is this frustration that has brought me to where I am today; dedicating myself to the challenge of overcoming that final hurdle intelligently, and bringing my designs into the real world.:::1553:::243:::0.08277777777777777:::0.4103968253968255:::5:::16:::2013|||"

Writing, producing, and directing short films has not only become a hobby of Alex’s while pursing academia, but a way to further his goal of bringing a feature script to production.

"2021000325:::266462657:::Castwave Studios:::In 2009, longtime friends Justin Eisenstadt and Colin Caccamise started a show called ""Boldly Going Nowhere"". It was a podcast that discussed the minutia of the twenty-something life. Music, film and the general stupidity of mankind were the popular topics in their first year. After a while, they discussed more and more diverse topics and changed their format up (multiple times). They started going out and checking events in the local area and interviewed more interesting people as time went on.

Enter Sean Holmes. Sean and Colin were college friends, who met via Frederick Community College's Digital Media program. Sean brought a fresh new sense of humor, as well as tech and insane attention to detail (in audio edits) that was lacking in the early episodes. Sean moonlighted as a host on BGN, as well as his own show B & S Reviews, with his childhood friend Benjamin Price II. They had a similar format to BGN, but with a far different approach that worked well with their style of comedy. Eventually, Sean had the idea to combine efforts and bring the shows together and create something more than a few podcasts. He envisioned a studio where local artists could pool their resources and create more than just audio content. He thought about assisting those who wanted to create, but didn’t have the means or inspiration to. Thus, Castwave Studios was created soon after.

Soon after the two shows merged as a studio, they opened a new segment called ""BGN Correspondence"", which was series of short reviews and sketches cultivated into introducing more content to the website. Out of this show came two segments in particular, One Drunk Geek and The SynapZe Reviews, One Drunk Geek became its own webcast hosted by Brian Massey, whereas The SynapZe Reviews... was a testing ground for Jordan Hazelwood's work on the Film.Lovables/Castwave joint Geek Criteek. Both shows have now become staples of Castwave on YouTube.

With all this that happened in only three years, we're still on the lookout for new talent, new shows and new guests to host! As we grow bigger, we still are looking for more local contributors to discuss things across the geek spectrum. If you are ever interested in releasing material under the Castwave banner, you can contact us and we can help produce/promote your material! Castwave Studios, it's entertainment for nerds, by nerds.:::2373:::401:::0.13029401154401155:::0.3558441558441558:::1:::0:::2017|||"

"242077426:::843789824:::Giles Duley:::Duley is a documentary photographer and writer, born in 1971 in London. His work focuses on the long-term humanitarian impact of conflict. Starting his carer as a music photographer, Duley worked with the likes of Mariah Carey, Oasis and Lenny Kravitz for publications including Q, Vogue, Sunday Times and Elle. In 2000 his image of Marilyn Manson was voted amongst the 100 greatest rock photographs of all time.
In 2004 Duley changed his focus to documentary work, partnering with well-respected charities such as HI (Humanity and Inclusion), EMERGENCY, Save the Children and UNHCR to highlight lesser-known stories deserving of public attention and action. Although documenting challenging, and at times, horrific situations, Giles captures the strength of those who fight adversity rather than succumb. His photographs draw the viewer to the subject, creating intimacy and empathy for lives differing from ours only in circumstance.
His work has taken him to Iraq, Afghanistan, South Sudan, DR Congo, Angola, Bangladesh, Kenya, Ukraine, Jordan, Lebanon, Colombia, Vietnam and Nigeria among others.
In 2015 he started his Legacy of War project, which looks to explore common themes of conflict. A core part of the project is collaborations with other artists and writers to reach a wider audience. These collaborations have included the musicians Massive Attack and PJ Harvey.
In 2011, whilst working in Afghanistan, Duley was severely injured by an IED. As a result of his injuries he is a triple-amputee. In 2012 he returned to Afghanistan to continue his work as a photographer.
Duley is also CEO and Founder of the NGO Legacy of War Foundation and is a campaigner for the rights of both refugees and those living with disability caused by conflict. His work has been exhibited and published worldwide.
In 2019 he was awarded the Amnesty Media Award for Photojournalism.:::1881:::299:::0.022450980392156858:::0.29029411764705887:::2:::7:::2013|||"

There's not one Tiki Bar in Orange County that honors the beginnings of this truly fascinating and mystical movement. My handcrafted cocktails will give the people of OC a sense of the true flavors of Tiki (blended Pina Coladas and Mai Tais with multiple juices and floats on top are not Tiki).

"511463766:::1779729416:::Mr. Brian Wallace:::My spark for chocolate began when I snacked on my first handful of whole cacao beans - the seeds of the Theobroma cacao tree and the botanical source of all things chocolate. A subtle euphoria gently washed over me, awakening my mind & enlivening me from within. I quickly realized that the “chocolate” I’d had most of my life was so over-processed and diluted with additives & junk that it barely resembled the original sacred seed it was derived from. A few months later, I quit my job to travel the world in search of the perfect cacao bean, and to apprentice with any teacher who would share their skills with me. I became inspired to create a new style of chocolate, one that synthesized classical European technology, modern nutritional research, and the ethereal aspects of cacao familiar to the cultures of the Americas that have used it for thousands of years. I founded Endorfin several years and hundreds of recipes later, to reintroduce cacao to the modern world as the delicious, uplifting ‘food of the gods’ that it once was.:::1039:::184:::0.1969760101010101:::0.4036237373737374:::3:::46:::2011|||"

"574824705:::892057674:::Seadon:::The Outdoors give us energy. Being outside connects us, recharges our body and mind, and it just naturally makes us feel good. The outdoor clothing industry pride itself on the ability to connect people with the outdoors, yet all too often, this connection comes at the cost of the very thing we enjoy spending so much time in. There are a lot of nasty stuff happening behind closed doors in the clothing industry that are kept away from customers for a number of reasons- from fabrics being treated with un-known and toxic chemicals, made with non-renewable resources such as oil (dirty!) to produce, to cheap and unfair labour working in poor conditions. The result is often a product that is taxing on the planet, made cheaply and sold at a premium price.

But we are not here to point fingers. We are here to add that extra sustainable and ethical touch of ours, to the highly-functional gear that we make. Imagine the feeling of being able to fully appreciate the outdoors with your gear, knowing that you're part of a gang of outdoor warriors who believe changes can be made for the better, and pledging for a healthy planet.

This is who we are at Seadon.

‘Seadon’ is an English name, meaning ‘From the Hill, by the Sea.’ We consider ourselves a bunch of outdoor enthusiasts first, designers and makers second. We believe in order to design and make the best products for the outdoors; one must first understand the culture, connect with the people, and immerse in our planet. We welcome you all with open doors with the launch of our first product- The Regenerative Tee.:::1585:::282:::0.15192307692307694:::0.359017094017094:::2:::34:::2017|||"

"1940114350:::1000739467:::bachor:::A graduate of the Center for Creative Studies in downtown Detroit, former Michigander Jim Bachor has lived in Chicago now for 32 years. Jim started his career in 1989 as a graphic designer for Words&Pictures Inc., a creative marketing communication firm. By 1991, he was co-owner and Principal Creative Officer of the firm. In 2000, he joined the Chicago advertising agency Draftfcb. As an Associate Creative Director, Jim’s worked on a variety of clients, including Kraft, SCJohnson, Dow Chemical, Brookfield Zoo and John Deere.

Jim Bachor’s fervor for mosaic art was born in 1998 when he first traveled to Europe and enveloped himself in the culture of London, Rome and Paris. Then for two months in 1999, Jim rented an apartment in Rome, exploring the ancient sites of the city and surrounding countryside. Inspired to learn more about his newly found infatuation, later that same year Jim went back to Italy and took classes in Ravenna on the demanding and meticulous art form. During subsequent archaeology-based trips to Greece, Turkey and even a dig in Pompeii, he was amazed by the various examples of 2,000 year-old art buried deep in the ground. Marble and glass don't fade so mosaics look exactly as intended by the artist who originally produced them.

Jim has adapted this ancient art form to contemporary American life, capturing everyday scenes in a way that, centuries from now, will open a window onto life in the 21st century. To see his works visit www.bachor.com.:::1488:::253:::0.13053661616161616:::0.3571590909090909:::5:::8:::2015|||"

"2070215502:::581029022:::Solofon:::Hello, my name is Michael Abrams and I am 37 years old now. Before I came up to the idea of “Solofon”, I had to work hard in different spheres. At the age of 21, I’ve got “master of law” and graduated from my first university and started to build up my career. I was working hard and my work was fully paid off. I became CEO of the biggest packaging company in the region after 3 years. Just after that, I realized my blind spots in finance and decided to go to the university to get my finance degree. That was really hard but really amazing time to combine position of student and CEO. After I’ve got my “master of finance” I wanted the development. So I paid my attention to the hotel business. Within some years I became the owner of the hotel business in different countries. I had to travel a lot because of my business. Every time and everywhere I go I faced the problem that you can freely rent hotels, apartments or cars, but if you need something specific it’s usually tricky. Sometimes you aren’t able to rent something specific like boats, RVs or motorcycles because of the language issues, inconvenient location, or pricing. Or even you can ran into scams and lose your money. That’s why I decided why not to change the rules of the game and build up something cool and convenient for everyone to resolve all described issues. The main idea of Solofon is not only recreational vehicle app. It’s only the beginning. I think we all can create something better. The eco-system where everyone can easily and securely earn and spend money, where everyone can start his own business as simple as 1,2,3. Where your clients can become your best friends, and where you can fully trust people because they care about their reputation. But I can’t do it alone. I really need your support. Please join Solofon and refer it to friends, so we all can build up not just simply the app but the community.:::1901:::367:::0.07391304347826087:::0.3849896480331263:::1:::0:::2018|||"

I have been married to my wonderful husband Danny for nearly 17 years. I became a mother to his twin 9 yr old sons at the age of 21. We fell in love and married him in 2001. Soon after our family grew. We now have the 27 year old twin sons, a 16, 14, and 3 year old daughters. I always wanted to be a “baby” nurse and as I was trained as an RN to care for babies, I fell in love with birth. Starting out in a highly medicallized L&D unit and I quickly learned about the high risk pregnancies. As I continued my career and furthered my education as a Certified Nurse Midwife I become more intrigued with normal physiologic birth. I absolutely love seeing a family grow and the intimacy a newborn brings to families. I am currently a full scope practicing CNM at William Newton Hospital in Winfield, KS and have delivered nearly 1000 babies in the past 7 years.

My husband started out doing waterlines for his grandfather's pipeline business in OK. He worked in welding when the boys were small and joined a construction crew and built/remodeled houses for many years. Shortly after we were married he returned to school to learn the HVAC trade. He accelerated in this field and followed his mentor to hospital HVAC crew. Groomed for leadership he became the hospital director of maintenance. This has allowed him to be very knowledgeable in code requirements for local and State fire marshals.

This dream of a freestanding accredited birthcenter allows for us both to bring our careers together by combining our passions❣️

"517639892:::277791694:::Lee Metcalfe:::Lee is based in Lancaster and his photography interest started in his teens, messing around with 35mm film compacts, until he bought a second hand 35mm Zenith EM just after he started work. He soon realised that he had an eye for composition and camera skills came naturally. Without any formal training, Lee's photography knowledge is entirely self taught and he turned professional in 2008. Currently, Lee exclusively uses Nikon Professional digital equipment for his commission and wildlife work and a Fuji GX617 Panoramic and Fuji GSW690 film cameras for all his other work.

Lee's passion has always been for Landscape photography, favouring the rich colours of dawn and dusk when the light is at its most special. Landscape photography is not just about photographing the land, but capturing how the light falls on it. This requires pre visualizing the scene, visiting the location at varying times of the day (and season), and then it's a matter of waiting. He has had many fruitless trips when, on arrival at a location, conditions have changed for the worst, which can be really frustrating. Lee finds that the Lake District is a real challenge, proving to be an exercise in patience.

Being renowned for perfecting an image ""in camera"", Lee is able to capture magical moments authentically at the picture taking stage, creating stunning and natural landscapes. Lee's photography is a mix of technical knowledge and creative vision; always looking for new locations and striving for the perfect image. Lee's photography is an ever expanding business, from sales of prints, commissions and exhibitions, to talks, workshops and tutorials.:::1649:::271:::0.1384063852813853:::0.4005411255411255:::1:::1:::2018|||"

"1904774848:::1635829371:::Nicolas Simon:::Nicolas caught the hospitality bug upon graduating from one of the top business schools in France. Various hotel experiences with Byblos Saint-Tropez, Four Seasons Paris then Geneva and Plaza-Athénée back in Paris defined his all-around profile in the industry, from F&B operations to finance and marketing.

He then became managing partner in three stand-alone restaurants (two of them being awarded a Michelin star within the first year), before being appointed Alain Ducasse’s Director of Operations North America and move to New York City eleven years ago.

Once an entrepreneur, always an entrepreneur though, and Nicolas has recently started his own business venture. Guess what? A full service hospitality workshop, of course!

A few characteristics to define him, in no specific order: well-organized, hard worker, impatient, funny, shy, obstinate, perfectionist, efficient, result-driven, considerate, rational, determined, clumsy, rallying, committed…

What about a few hints of his life outside of work? Well, he is really crazy about skiing, in all seasons and whatever the weather conditions are! Sports and outdoor activities in general are two favorites of his: running a lot, tennis (his lefty two-hand backhand is quite impressive), mountain biking… One of his best souvenirs is actually carrying the Olympic torch for the 1992 winter games!
In his hometown of Toulouse, France it is all about rugby and great food shared with family and friends, and these values of team effort and generosity will forever drive him.:::1543:::238:::0.18996632996632995:::0.49069023569023573:::1:::0:::2013|||"

As with most of my class, playing started early. Right away with such great games as ""Civilisation"" and ""Shogun"". Of course, role-playing games were also totally mine; MERS, DSA, D&D and of course ""Paranoia!"", countless hours we put ourselves in foreign minds and worlds and dealt intensively with the most diverse challenges; it's a pity that this has gone out of fashion, we learned a lot from each other and from each other.
Then you somehow reached an age where gambling had diminished a little - luckily never quite with us! - and out of the blue the ""Settlers of Catan"" appeared and suddenly everything in the world of board games was upside down. Even those who only knew ""Kniffel"", ""Rumikub"" and ""Schattenhalma"" were now tied to the board.
At that time I started to change and extend existing games (the original Catan was of course much too small for me ;-)) and then to develop my own games, which always happened only for the circle of friends, because the games - from today's point of view - were unplayable.
What has remained is our roleplaying project ""Annor - Das Schwert von Esper"", which emerged from a project week at school and is still alive today and is still being developed further by one of our comrades-in-arms from the very beginning.:::1402:::237:::0.09003894767783657:::0.5981995884773662:::1:::7:::2017|||"

"1935336651:::1537303252:::Josh Zepess:::Good morning! My name is Josh and I’m a Freedom fighter. Not like the ones in the movies, rather like the ones in real life that see an unjust enslavement and can no longer sit idly by while good people suffer in bad ways. What is Freedom anyways? Most people seem to have a good definition. It’s control. Doing what we want, when we want, how we want, with whom we want, etc. But then they can’t answer the next question, “In a free country, how is it that so few of us are truly free?”

You see, I wasn’t always a Freedom fighter. Before this, I was in for 20 years. Twenty years of looking at gray walls, wondering what life was like on the outside. It’s not like I was a bad person. After all, I just did what I was told. Yet here I was, on my best behavior. You know what I’m talking about, don’t you? That’s right, Corporate America. Honestly, I don’t have the typical story where I was suddenly laid off and had to restart my career at 40 years old. Rather I had plenty of success and what most would consider a very great multi-six-figure income as an engineer. I really had no reason to complain as I was in the comfort zone. Yes, I said the “C” word – comfort. Don’t get me wrong. On the beach in Mexico, drink in my hand, toes in the sand…great place to be comfortable. But in business and life, it’s not the place to be nor the place you can stay. Then one day, everything I thought was right wasn’t so right. I wasn’t free. I was in the rat race. The joke about the rat race is that even if you win, you’re still just a rat. So I escaped. Off the wheel and onto the streets. From being self-employed to independent business owner in the gym industry, to franchises, I was digging into all areas trying to figure out how to build the right vehicle for my road to Freedom. What I realized is that for me to get to where I want to go, I have to help others get to where they want to go. And so Broke Is No Joke was born. I’m blessed, and now I wish to be a blessing onto others.:::1990:::428:::0.14363839285714286:::0.2613901289682539:::1:::12:::2019|||"

His vocals are perfectly reigned in to suit his range and his easy gift for melody is unrivaled in the Bay area singer-songwriter space Kristopher James
is perhaps the most interesting local musician on the scene” – Creative Loafing Tampa:::1054:::174:::0.10715157858015001:::0.3799995639281354:::1:::2:::2014|||"

"661372057:::1112424340:::Mike Ward:::Hello Fellow Health Fans,

I’m a chef, father to two young girls, and a relatively active guy - but not obsessive, I eat mostly clean, but I love a glass of wine, and I don’t always make the best food and drink decisions (I have a crazy sweet tooth). I am however a food and drink label geek – I Google those odd ingredients at the bottom of labels. I like to know what I’m consuming. I created this product and launched this campaign because I believe there are others out there like me that are looking for nutrient driven hydration drinks that don't contain all the garbage-laboratory created chemicals and additives we’ve simple come to expect with so called “sports drinks’ and smart waters.

We have spent the last six months obsessing over a product we believe in. And we know that once you try it, taste it, and experience how you feel you too will become a fan.

I invite you to join us by investing in your health. It’s the one gift you not only give to yourself but to those who love you. The best of health,

"1002430443:::1860321475:::Satanic Panic Miniatures:::Harking back to my introduction to the hobby in 1981, I have lived, breathed and wept gaming ever since.

I've managed game stores, written and had published, a successful gaming memoir and now work as a professional miniature painter and supplier of scenic materials. Satanic Panic Miniatures is the last thing on my 'wargaming bucket list' and, it's my mission to make fun, varied and affordable figures so that gamers can build the big armies in the style of those which inspired so many gamers in the 80s, without leaving their descendants destitute.


Satanic Panic is not about 'getting rich', it's about leaving a legacy to a hobby which has given me so much pleasure across 4 decades whilst making a modest living.


It's my hope that when I 'pass into the West' one if not all of my grandsons will continue my work (although I am not planning on going anywhere yet) and find and give the joy of gaming that I've known. (Don't panic I am only 51!)


Satanic Panic Miniatures is a family sized business without the assets or conversely, the overheads of larger businesses. I want to trade ethically and innovatively. For a start, I have deliberately decided to shun the concept of complex packaging. It serves no purpose other than to add cost to you the purchaser and to the burden of trash upon the environment. I also intend to LISTEN. If you see a viable gap in a range I want you to let me know and if I can - I'll fill it. After all, more models can only ever be a good thing!


With the support and passion of likeminded gamers, I think I can can do brilliant things.


And in case you wondered, the Satanic Panic brand is inspired by the the 80s panic of the same name, which saw my generation labelled as demon-worshipping fiends by people who didn't know what the whole gaming thing was about. They were 'interesting times' and this is my nod of acknowledgement to those days when many hobby pioneers and future grognard gamers first fumbled in their dice bags and resisted the overwhelming pressures from people who didn't understand that gaming was merely about 'let's pretend' on a grand scale.:::2131:::385:::0.18802083333333333:::0.4449776785714286:::2:::6:::2012|||"

"1328225661:::80930031:::Alexandre Rockwell:::Alexandre Rockwell is best known for directing IN THE SOUP and 13 MOONS. Alex's characters are as intricate as they are flawed. He abstains from the shotgun pop of mainstream film and uses classical techniques and creativity to tell stories.

His first feature film, LENZ was shown at the 1982 Berlin Film Festival. He followed that up with HERO which won a Special Jury Prize at the U.S. Film Festival in 1984. At Sundance Film Festival a few years later, IN THE SOUP won the Grand Prize. It went on to its European premiere at the Venice Film Festival and received awards at Deauville, Chicago and other top festivals. The movie starred Steve Buscemi, Seymour Cassel, Stanley Tucci, Sam Rockwell, and his then wife Jennifer Beals--many of which remain frequent collaborators. The success of IN THE SOUP solidified Alex as an iconoclast of the independent New York film movement of the nineties. Alex became a professor at NYU Tisch's Graduate Film department in 2007 where he continues to teach.

In 2009, he completed the feature PETE SMALLS IS DEAD starring Peter Dinklage, Tim Roth, and Steve Buscemi. And the crew included many of his former grad students. It went on to premiere at the Rome International Film Festival and is currently being distributed worldwide by W2 Media.:::1287:::220:::0.12519980019980023:::0.28509823509823506:::2:::10:::2014|||"

"1920720624:::2015192908:::Scott Serkland:::Scott Serkland was once a mild mannered illustrator and designer. That was until the effects of an unfortunate incident involving a microwave oven and a can of processed squeeze cheese changed his life forever. Now Serkland burns the midnight oil in his underground factory/laboratory creating robots, aliens zombies, and other imminent threats to humanity in his never ending quest to take over the world. Serkland soon discovered that world domination is a lonely business so he formed Serkworks Art Labs in order to help like-minded would-be world conquerors achieve the same level of success. In doing so, Serkworks Art Labs has introduced a line of geeky mad science themed products. Serkworks' brand merchandise is perfect for decorating your own secret lair, accenting your personal madcap style, or assisting you in devising your maniacal master plan.:::859:::135:::-0.09166666666666667:::0.65:::2:::46:::2011|||"

About Us

Sometimes the American West looks alien to those of us who have lived here longer than a decade. Things change irrevocably: Landscapes erode and seem to dwindle, views get obstructed, towns turn ghostly or expand exponentially, black soil fades into dust, new industries and ideas call into question our most cherished traditions and notions.

We see ever more clearly that the origins of these changes lie in our tangled history, a history that gets ever more complex the closer we look. It is a history that—despite (or because of) its challenges—has created a marvelously vibrant culture, one that embraces many thriving subcultures within its fluid boundaries.

Drumlummon Institute, headquartered in Helena, Montana, aims to explore these complexities in hopes that we can better understand our past and take better care in our present.

We will undertake an ambitious and ongoing examination of our region’s culture(s), especially the rich panoply of artistic expressions. To disseminate the outcomes of this examination, we will publish books and an online journal, sponsor symposia and conferences, collaborate with other cultural institutions, and produce documentaries and audio recordings.

"503173419:::853235882:::Ronald Bayens:::Ronald Bayens is considered one of the most sought after portrait artists in the country. He has been painting professionally for 25 years and his work hangs in public and private collections throughout America, Canada, and Europe. His published work is sold worldwide.

Ronald came to The United States from Canada in 1995 to pursue a career in portrait work. The southeast has a long and proud tradition of portraiture that continues to this day. He was quickly embraced by the South and has been an in-demand portrait artist ever since. With hundreds of satisfied clients, word spread quickly and now Ronald is regarded as one of the leading artists in the country. His portraits and fine art hang in many leading universities, museums, hospitals and private homes.

He enjoys painting commissioned works and teaching students in his studio on his property in the beautiful Blue Ridge Mountains.

Ronald resides in Bristol, Tennessee with his wife Beth and, during university breaks, their two youngest (out of five) children. Ron enjoys camping, canoeing, biking the and reading biographies and/or historical nonfiction wherever his trips take him.

The anything-could-happen feel of a Session show depends on craft that's not accidental or easilywon; they bring a kind of ease and genuineness to this timeless music, sometimes presenting the latest batch of original songs, sometimes reaching back into depths of the American ""song bag"".:::883:::147:::0.1326041666666667:::0.5696875:::7:::4:::2011|||"

Writing the songs on ""Fly on the Wall"" reminded me each day that every other person in the world has a story just as meaningful and complex as my own. Nevertheless, there are certain passions, experiences, and feelings we all have in common. Nothing allows us to experience those emotions that bond us together like music.

"819938531:::1338348778:::Keira Kemp:::There is a major problem today with how businesses run their dirty business. By that I mean what really goes on in the garbage room. While you and I make efforts at home to separate our disposables and recyclables, companies have not followed suit. My plan is to give large companies who do not currently recycle incentive to start recycling their paper and card-boards. I will do this by producing a recycled product to sell back to these companies that is at least 20% cheaper than the cost of current supplies ie. paper, filing boxes, paper cups etc. Why are recycled products more expensive? The process in a single stream recycling facility is less cost efficient than milling virgin paper.
The plan is to cut costs in production/process by only collecting paper and card-boards, saving on sorting expenses. I will also be implementing an enzyme to de-ink papers that does not use toxic chemicals. As well as integrating hemp into the paper fibers to strengthen the products produced. Hemp can be recycled 10x compared to paper, only 3x. Hemp also takes 20 weeks to come to grow vs 20 years.
Your support to help me kickstart this business will be greatly appreciated. Please help me change the minds of companies when it comes to recycling and help stop deforestation.:::1276:::219:::-0.015793650793650787:::0.30767857142857136:::1:::0:::2019|||"

At around 9 and 10 years of age, I used to sit down outside and show hockey cards to my beloved dog Spotty. I also made mini baseball games in the dirt with sticks and small pebbles. And best of all, I used to cut out those same hockey cards and play hockey at the kitchen table, with a silver ball for the puck: the foil from my mother's cigarette package.

Fast forward to the late 90's, I got an eye injury at work, which made me photophobic. I couldn't take bright lights and had to wear sunglasses all the time outside. I couldn't watch TV and I couldn't work on computers. The kids and I seemed to go back in time, and we spent many evenings reading, listening to the radio and playing games. Much to my surprise, I began to invent games again ...

I have had lots of help through the years, and I thank God for each person and each invention. I hope you will enjoy the games we bring here. Caper Games - bringing games to life! Enjoy! Randall:::1336:::250:::0.13415637860082305:::0.27132201646090537:::24:::43:::2015|||"

PREMESSA Nonostante tutto il progresso scientifico e tecnologico, gli esseri umani conservano il desiderio di fare ""sogni lucidi""; ovvero sentirsi coinvolti in qualcosa che si trovi a metà strada tra pazzia e razionalità, sogno e realtà, “divertimento” e “salvazione”. Ogni volta che si comincia un nuovo lavoro, bisogna camminare come funamboli, stare in equilibro su una linea sottile... Non è più significativo stupirsi e stupire con effetti speciali o la manipolazione emozionale, perché si possono trovare ovunque; l'arte non è un fine ma un mezzo, recentemente è diventato un fine ma un tempo era un mezzo, per offrire l'accesso ai livelli più sublimi del creato; solo in questo senso l'arte è assolutamente necessaria e va salvata! PREMISE Despite all the scientific and technological progress, human beings retain the desire to make ""lucid dreams""; or feel involved in something that is halfway between madness and rationality, dream and reality, ""fun"" and ""salvation"". Every time you start a new job, you have to walk like tightrope walkers, stay in balance on a thin line ... It is no longer meaningful to be surprised and amazed with special effects or emotional manipulation, because they can be found everywhere; art is not an end but a means, it has recently become an end but once it was a means, to offer access to the most sublime levels of creation; only in this sense is art absolutely necessary and must be saved!:::1455:::242:::0.1115124458874459:::0.32895021645021644:::1:::0:::2019|||"

Our story begins in 2017 when our co-founder, Clement, then a semi-competitive mobile gamer and streamer, had the opportunity to experience the problems in the mobile gaming scene. Surprised that there weren't many options to make gaming better on the smartphone, together with Seth, they had countless brainstorming sessions to develop the best mobile gaming accessories possible to bring about the ultimate gaming experience.

Seth wanted something premium that was unrivalled in quality and Clement wanted something that was reasonably priced and made available for everyone, and thus StygianForce was born.:::934:::140:::0.22444444444444445:::0.4869047619047619:::1:::0:::2019|||"

The company is called Our/Vodka and it's a global family of local vodkas made in urban micro distilleries that we've built. We started with Our/Berlin, then Our/Detroit, Our/Amsterdam, Our/Seattle, Our/London, Our/Los Angeles and last but not least, Our/New York. Each local distillery is ran by local people and their vodka is made by local ingredients. Building micro distilleries in city centers is almost impossible and Our/New York took over 5 years to open. We had over 120 meetings with local authorities in NYC and only the building permit took over 2 years to get. Now we are the first distillery in Manhattan since prohibition!

Hailing from Hawaii, Alanaleilani is a Hapa Haole that knows a thing or two about living on an island -granted, her neighborhood was lacking in both Minotaurs and Harpies.


Housing a passion for reading from a young age, that thirst quickly turned to writing. Starting with short stories and quickly progressing to full length novels, she continued to practice her craft until one of her scripts was picked up by a Visual Novel company. After producing three different games with them, she realized she had an idea of her own she wanted to pursue, one that featured people of all races and body types, one with real personalities instead of cardboard cut outs and archetypes. Something that reminded her a bit of home, with a bit more fantasy thrown in there.

From Curitiba, Brazil, Roger Pugh has been passionate about programming for twenty years. Hopping head first into the hobby, he soon was able to find work on a game, and was hooked from there. With two games fully published under his name, one of them being ""Heavy Metal Machines"" (currently available on steam), and many other smaller projects, he is excited to craft the backbone of the Love Mythos experience.
Although his day job might be working regularly with boring corporate software development, world building is his love. Whether it's terrain paging solutions in Unity for a 3D world rendering component, or playing with computer graphics, programming is often just as rewarding as it is stressful. His favorite character is whichever has the least amount of bug fixes in their chapters Character, Background, and UI Artist:

Meet our Artist, a talent with an eye for backgrounds and mythological creature anatomy! Sandy Hong grew up in Northern Virginia, and quickly fell in love with animation. Whether it was captivating movies on the big screen, or goofy episodes on her television, Sandy ate it up. When told she needed to grow up, she did, and made her way to the Big Apple in 2005 to pursue her dream of studying animation at the School of Visual Arts. Probably not what the original speaker intended.

After graduating in 2009, (and some solid convincing herself that her degree was not a waste), Sandy ended up at her dream job at Nickelodeon as a background designer. There she excelled and found her true talents in composition, creating breathtaking backdrops, and even won an audience choice award in a Film Race. With plenty of growth under her belt, Sandy left her Nickelodeon family and decided to focus on her passion for video games. She is now contributing as a freelance game artist assisting various indie game studios. Composer:

After recently graduating from UC Davis with a B.S. in Evolution, Ecology, and Biodiversity, Steven decided to put his true passions to work, and joined the SquidSinSquad to create music for a unique and truly interesting addition to the Visual Novel genre. Steven has interests in most genres of music, and has been influenced by various artists and composers, including: Nujabes, Shoji Meguro, Takeharu Ishimoto, Yasunori Mitsuda and Nobuo Uematsu. Steven has incorporated his most keen interests into the sound and music of LoveMythos in the hopes of giving it a fun and inviting audio aesthetic that compliments the mood and cadence of the story. When he’s not writing “dulcet tones” for games, Steven is often lost in the dense haze of an anime and/or video game bender that can last anywhere from hours to the rest of his adult life.:::3627:::613:::0.19435952380952387:::0.4738692307692308:::2:::1:::2017|||"

"42121335:::1787153077:::Luke Mitchem:::There’s a wind that blows through the corners of Missouri and wraps its hands around the souls of the young, offering passage to the edges of the world. The wind does not promise riches nor fame, only adventure, hardship, tragedy and eventually triumph. And in every soul, the beholder chooses to be swept away by the howling wind or to stand their ground in the soil of their heartland. Luke Mitchem allowed his soul to be carried away…

Nestled in the southwest corner of Missouri as a child of a nurse and a metal maker, Luke was warmed by the voices of Bruce Springsteen, Jim Croce, and The Doors.. The passing of the seasons brought on influences from The Counting Crows and late nights watching Tom Waits performances on MTV. And like an aged Kentucky bourbon, Luke’s love for music matured over time from fan to writer to performer...

With a batch full of poems turned into songs, the Missouri wind carried Luke to the mountains of Colorado to record his first of three albums at Over The Mountain Recording Studio. Recorded in 6 days, during which his greatest musical inspiration passed away, Luke channeled his love and loss into It Won’t Last Forever. Shortly thereafter, Luke recorded his follow up albums, A Fading Frontier and Love, Laura and The Bomb, which chronicled the beginning, middle, and end of a ‘fragile love story’...

A ‘long winter’ allowed Luke to focus on his most ambitious recordings to date in the name of Winter Kissing on the Spring. Recorded at The Great Northern Sound Society studio in Parsonsfield, Maine in 10 days, Luke and his ever growing Endless Spirits Band locked themselves away in the late 1700s farmhouse and recorded his most ‘realized’ album in the Spring of 2012…

Fast forward 2 years and past one major back surgery and Luke is on the cusp of releasing his 5th album, For You, I Built a Mountain. Traveling through the fading frontiers and the mountains of the West, Luke allowed the wind to sweep his heart/soul/mind to American Fork, Utah, where he recorded with one of his most influential inspirations, Joshua James. In the heart of Willamette Mountain Studios, Luke channeled the spirits of the wolves, the chants of the ghosts, and the howl of the wind to free his voice...:::2242:::400:::0.13005050505050508:::0.44337121212121205:::2:::82:::2011|||"

"535452109:::297006513:::Waterwell:::WATERWELL (Lee Sunday Evans, Artistic Director; Adam Frank, Managing Director; Heather Lanza, Director of Education) is a unique ensemble of theater artists dedicated to the creation of new work and the bold re-interpretation of classics. Founded in 2002 by Arian Moayed and Tom Ridgely, the company’s special blend of music, theater and social dialog has been nominated for three IT awards, a Drama Desk, a New York Magazine Culture Award and a Village Voice Best of NYC. The Voice calls them, “dynamic, resourceful and relentlessly entertaining.” And TheaterScene says, “There's no way a written description can do justice to their blazing energy and inventiveness.” The New York Times hails the work as, “brilliant, original and inspired. Alive enough to surprise even the performers themselves,” and Theatermania writes, “Waterwell has staked a claim on our collective conscience.” Since 2003, Waterwell has also offered structured classes in collaborative playmaking, or ""devising"", the process by which the ensemble develops its material. By 2010 those educational activities had grown and coalesced into the Waterwell Drama Program , which now delivers – in partnership with the Professional Performing Arts School (PPAS) – top-quality, year-round, in-school theater training to over 200 NYC public school students. The program addresses the student-artist holistically and demands they develop both as an interpreter and as a creator. Voice and movement work connect with scene study and devising; classroom learning supports rehearsal and performance projects; and everything is designed to be in dialog with what's going on outside the classroom - in their homes, communities and the world at large.:::1709:::269:::0.19551252319109463:::0.37407235621521334:::8:::4:::2010|||"

Most importantly, we want to build top of the line software for our own use and for those of our fellow gamers around the world.

Fantasy Grounds was one of the first products of its kind and it does a great job of bringing the joy of roleplaying with friends in the basement to an online environment. Since we've taken over in 2009, we've injected many more features, free art assets and modules and connected with a number of leading publishers in the gaming industry to bring direct translations of popular gaming systems and adventure modules into Fantasy Grounds. In 2014, Fantasy Grounds became the only virtual tabletop to ever receive an official license to carry Dungeons & Dragons products. We have the most officially licensed game systems of any virtual tabletop software.

Our community is quite strong and has continued to grow over the years. It now exceeds 130,000 licensed users and an unknown number of users connecting to GMs running Ultimate licenses. We've built Fantasy Grounds to be customized, re-skinned, tweaked and used as an engine to create your own adventures for others to share. We often engage our most prolific members of the community to perform additional commissioned work for us and it has allowed us to do much more than a small dev shop would normally be able to accomplish.:::1626:::274:::0.28152777777777777:::0.5754513888888889:::1:::39:::2012|||"

"1938018262:::1327471294:::ModBlokz:::The ModBLokz Team

Ashley - I started wargaming 14 years ago but have started playing more seriously in the past 8. I mainly play Warhammer 40k, but have dabbled in many different games in my recent years: including imperial assault, Malifuax, Decent and infinity to name a few. I enjoy the immersion that comes from controlling units, or role playing a single character in these games using your surroundings to out think your opponents, and as such wanted to make ModBlokz a system without limits. Throughout the development process I have been making sure that it is as interchangeable as possible to allow you to rebuild your maps as if you were working in a sandbox environment, and that paint adheres to the materials we have been using as I know how much of a draw being able to paint your buildings to your own specification can be.

Thomas - Currently employed as an Associate Lecturer in CAD at Yeovil College and a Retail Technical Specialist at Telefonica UK.
Used to run a cosplay prop manufacture business - Have experience in silicon moulding and extensive experience in 3D Printing.

I have always been passionate about architecture and have a fascination for miniatures. It is a combination of these interests that have motivated me to self-learn CAD to a level that I now teach courses at my local college. That has spurred me on to create ModBlokz and fill the void in my miniature scenery requirements.:::1429:::242:::0.05525573192239859:::0.3846031746031746:::2:::0:::2018|||"

"1520276088:::1888322542:::Lucy:::I was a child that dreamt amongst the leaves and ached to feed my bare warm toes in cool mud. Nature was my ever-generous treasure chest, gifting me sweet finds of nibbled nuts and pearlescent shells. I would store them for quiet admiration in used matchboxes and discarded camera film cases.
My struggles through my young life were always softened by the blackbirds’ song. Nature ran deep in my veins and I loved it whole heartedly. As I grew up my confidence slowly retreated, hiding itself beneath a fortress of brambles in my soul. I was constantly wandering my place, never fitting in. I daydreamed about frosty morning fields for most of my teenage years.
After applying myself to many jobs that never quite felt right I realised that my release was to come home and create the wanders I had seen. Could I possibly turn this passion into something that feeds me? just as nature had done for my soul for all those years. I worried that with no formal training I would dissolve into the background but once more she was there to reassure me that she is my college of wild. So I simply began and with it the brambles that for so long encased my confidence began to flower. So that is how I find myself sat here in a shed under the willow tree with needle, wool and a shelf full of treasures.:::1296:::239:::0.13758503401360542:::0.4521258503401361:::2:::1:::2019|||"

"1432818738:::2067125075:::Sergio Quinones:::Hi there, my name is Sergio and I was born in Mexico, my mother, my sisters and I moved to USA when I was 5 years old because life was hard for us at that time, specially for a single mother with 5 small children. All my life I've had to use hearing aids as I am deaf and I am currently unemployed but doing my best as a freelance translator (still haven't been able to get customers because of the competition) I don't have a proper hearing aid at the moment since the last one died out and they don’t come cheap where I live. I have severe loss and the generic hearing aids don't really help me, it is hard for me to get a job and this is due to safety issues in most jobs in my area. I am hoping that with this business I will be able to work on my own business and be able to afford my own hearing aids as well anytime. I also love writing so I hope that once I have enough time I can continue with that and publish my epic fantasy novel.:::942:::200:::0.2132770562770563:::0.48116666666666663:::1:::0:::2019|||"

"1558159541:::651203773:::Sunshadeau Arts:::Hello! I'm Sasha, the owner and founder of Sunshadeau Arts.

Sunshadeau Arts was born from a combination of my lifelong love of tabletop gaming, my 10+ years of professional art and design experience, and my disability.

Bet you didn't see that last bit coming. I mean who becomes disabled and then copes by starting a business? Well, I did!

Over two years ago I was diagnosed with 2 degenerative spinal conditions. That coupled with a car accident, left me with limited use of my right arm and hand. Since holding a paint brush was now a challenging experience, I looked to other ways to create. I discovered pouring acrylic and fell in love with the randomness of the process, that there is only so much you can do to control the creation and that each piece is completely unique.

So what about the gaming part? Well, while some families played/watched the sports ball together, my family played Dungeons and Dragons. I remember my dad letting me roll dice for the monsters when I was too little to play myself and I would sit and draw dragons at the gaming table. As the kids grew up and moved away, that part of my life faded even though I always kept a love of table top gaming. Fast forward to 3 years ago and my brother texts me and tells me I have to check out this new show called Critical Role. Thanks to the show and the advent of internet TTRPG platforms, we were inspired to strike up the game again. Today, I play with friends and family across the country twice a week.

I decided to combine my love of TTRPG's, pouring art, and design together to create unique, one of a kind artistic gaming gear for other gaming nerds and art lovers like me.

"1463502117:::457122554:::Caitlyn Jordan:::While studying at Saint Mary’s College, I worked as the photo editor for The Observer, Saint Mary’s College and the University of Notre Dame’s joint, student run newspaper, completed my thesis which focused on the Korean Comfort Women Movement and Girl of Peace statue for my Bachelor of Arts degree in Communication Studies with minors in Film Studies and Gender & Women’s Studies, and designed and completed an independent study, Check All That Applies, which focused on race and diversity relations on Saint Mary’s campus.

My thesis work was an ideological criticism with a focus on active public memory of the Girl of Peace Statue as well as the Wednesday Demonstrations which are held every Wednesday at noon in front of the Japanese Embassy in Seoul, South Korea. I used ideological criticism to present the argument that although the statue and demonstrations have played an important role in the success of the movement, it is the active participation of the public that has kept the memory of these women’s struggles alive in the present.

For my independent study, I interviewed and photographed Saint Mary’s College students in order for the public to gain an understanding of the narratives that college students have regarding their concepts of race, diversity, and race relations both on and off campus. I also focused on investigating how different interpretations and meanings given to race affect college students. The main questions I asked included: How do college students understand their own race? How race was talked about on campus? What students wanted to see more of on their campus in regards to race and diversity programs?

As a photo editor of The Observer, I photographed multiple events on both the campus of Saint Mary’s College and the University of Notre Dame such as Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Associate Justice Sonia Sotomayor, feminist speaker and writer Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, and the annual Take Back the Night march.

I am currently working towards a master’s degree in Journalism and Electronic Media from the University of Tennessee’s Communication and Information program. I work for both Professor Robert Heller and Professor Renee Smith as their graduate teaching assistant for their classes in Photojournalism and Diversity in U.S. Media. I also work as a photojournalist for The Daily Beacon, the school’s student run newspaper. I have photographed multiple events such as the 2019 Women’s March, women’s and men’s basketball, and city events. I work with undergraduates in the photo department to help improve their photography skills and techniques.:::2630:::447:::0.0667233560090703:::0.23725907029478455:::2:::0:::2019|||"

Why did we start Pompeak watches? Short answer - We saw an area in the market that has so far been filled poorly. There are plenty of ""affordable"" watch brands. But they all seem to sacrifice quality, and place clever marketing of poor products in its place.


As brothers we've worked closely and successfully on a number of personal projects, but this has been by far the most rewarding (if also the most challenging). Having two brains on the project has been a great advantage when tackling the more difficult decisions, each of us able to use our experience and skills to find the best outcome.

I had the idea after travelling and then coming back home and not being able to talk so easily to people because they weren't thinking about things I was thinking about. I wanted to find my people, speak to people who understood me and after looking online found no good solution for this. We should be able to find conversations in seconds because there are literally 100s of millions of people online now but there's no platform that allows you to start a conversation in a few seconds and there's no known name that everyone knows for finding conversations. After extensive design iterations and testing with a number of experts we've come up with a design that we believe will allow people to find any kind of relationship. Best way is to check it out at www.convose.com or download it through the app store.

Blind Beggar Miniatures has now run over forty successful Kickstarter campaigns, beginning with the Blind Beggar Launch campaign, which saw the birth of the company in December 2015,
Since then the Blind Beggar has added regular releases to those initial ranges of Pulp, Old West and Cthulhu Mythos themed miniatures.

2016 saw the introduction of the 'Outlanders' sci-fi setting, a range of figures suitable for classic sci-fi gaming that also work perfectly well for the Post-Apocalypse and Steampunk genres.

2017 saw the first of the Android Collectives come off of the production line. There are now almost thirty models in the range already and more are planned.

All of these ranges will see expansion with future releases on a regular basis, with the main emphasis being the expansion of the Outlanders range, but new ranges are in the development stage.

I hope that you like at least some of them and fancy taking part in one or more future campaigns to expand the range.:::1042:::172:::0.21739847454133168:::0.4722373856302428:::53:::16:::2013|||"

But before he started performing around Hawai’i Island and recording albums of original music, it was his dad’s Bob Dylan records that first inspired Dagan to pick up the guitar and to start putting words to music. So it was only natural that he would blend the sounds of acoustic folk and traditional Hawaiian to create his own version of American roots music. An honest love of the land, an appreciation of the simple ways of island life, and a respect for the people that make Hawai’i special - these are the topics that form the foundation of his original songs.:::961:::178:::0.28973935786435784:::0.5389195526695526:::1:::5:::2015|||"

"732388289:::1345638222:::Fennec Gaming LLC:::Fennec Gaming LLC is a company with a desire to bring mobile and tabletop games to you. We are a new aspiring company out of Hampton Roads, Virginia.

Our crew consists of 4 humans and a few kittens. Rayna, the lead designer of PAWperties, her wife Bree, and their best friend Theo and our awesome artist Wikimaru (Find him on Instagram!) (While writing this out, she had no idea of what to say and her kitten Nemo decided he wanted to clear off her desk, so she will go on to talk about her kittens.) Nemo, the fluffy trouble maker. He is only over a year old but is already a gigantic fluffball of trouble. He is the “typical thug” type of kitten who is willing to push anything and everything off a shelf just to sit down and creates complete chaos in the office on a regular basis. Guppy, the “pirate kitten”. He’s a little older than Nemo and ⅓ of the size. He is such a trooper; rescued at only 6 weeks old, his eyes were practically glued shut and he was expected to be completely blind. After constant care and the right medication as a kitten, he is only blind in one eye! When he was only a couple of months old he ran off, got caught under a car, and had to undergo surgery to remove a leg and his tail from the accident. For a cat who has been through so much in such a short period of time, having his perky little attitude isn’t expected at all. He’s one of the most loving kittens I’ve ever met. So in this game Guppy, sans one of his front legs and blind in one eye, is our “pirate” kitten inspiration.



another honorary human member of the team is Jessica. She has an amazingly awesome kitten. Mithra, a huge cat that we all really believe is just a shrunken black panther who is featured as Mafia Cat. Her late cat Gretta, this sweet girl is Happy Cat.:::1778:::354:::0.10596252705627707:::0.45030404317904316:::5:::8:::2016|||"

After having conversations with other printers who operate out of their home, I believe a cooperative space would be the most cost effective solution for myself and other home/garage printers alike. I’ve developed the name Masses Cooperative as a means to empower others to continue pursuing their own business efforts within an affordable structure to launch their idea into something real. I believe that print is for the masses, down to its beginnings it was meant to spread information and develop cultures. A space that encourages these values within a city as such as Orlando I believe is destined to be great."":::1124:::190:::0.1621031746031746:::0.47043650793650793:::1:::2:::2015|||"

My first music creation steps made in 1992 when using my parents computer I started to experiment with sounds and trackers trying to make music which was not easy to put in a certain style. That resulted in a range of live acts from 2004 in collaboration with several other musicians and visual artists. My first live solo project (2004) on stage was an atari-controlled orchestra of electronic child toys. Since then more audio-visual projects have been presented on stage. A significant milestone was establishing an electronic musical instruments company Ginkosynthese in 2012. The modules I make as Ginko Synthese have shaped my sound and I am always searching for new ideas to make non standard musical electronic instruments.:::813:::134:::0.10002190270047413:::0.43798830138115846:::3:::0:::2014|||

After a short time, as is my way, I gave up and placed what I had painted on eBay and they sold fast so I painted some more and again sold. I was contacted by a customer and asked to paint some more as a commission and this soon led to the start of perfect six painting service, a painting service dedicated to 1/300th ,1/285 scale figures. I found diorama basing for this scale works well and in fact better then well, it looks fantastic so I found myself searching the internet for suppliers of 1/300th quality scenic items. This is where my problems began as scenic’s were few and far between and the quality and range was up and down to say the least, so I decided to start sculpting my own bits and they looked good. From there, in 2015, I had a couple of bits manufactured in white metal and with just 6 product lines I started Perfect Six Scenic’s, a dedicated 1/300th scenic company, from there the company has slowly grown. now on the verge of releasing 28mm miniatures:::1294:::239:::0.2802248677248677:::0.5089191232048375:::4:::3:::2018|||"

"1294981709:::515394938:::Darren Doyle:::Hi everybody, I am a self-employed Graphic Designer based in Dublin, Ireland, and I was lucky enough to have grown up during the early culture of video games stretching back as far as 1979, at the tender age of 7 was when I experienced my first ever video game journey on the wonderful Atari VCS console and throughout the 1980's I was hooked. I began using Atari's 8-bit computer, from the Atari 800 to the Atari 130xe and eventually rocketed into the 16-bit days with the Atari ST and the Commodore Amiga in the 1990’s. So I've been around a while. My passion for video games has been so influential for a lot of my work I do today, both as an artist and a digital media designer, so with that knowledge, I decided to set out and created five digital magazines based on classic video game machines over the last 6 years, ranging from the Atari Computer 8-bit and 16-bit range (Atari Gamer and Atari ST Gamer) magazine series and a Nintendo NES system publication called ""NES-BIT"" followed by a collective collaboration with fellow retro gamers from all around the world in producing the very first proper bedroom coders ""Homebrew Heroes"" gaming magazine with a unique flair in both content and presentation.

So, I’m extremely passionate about this subject matter and my goal has always been to aspire in creating the most professional publications in celebration of this great past time and its systems. It is incredibly important to me to maintain quality over quantity on any future publications I work on and produce.:::1525:::272:::0.10537037037037038:::0.3106481481481482:::1:::11:::2011|||"

I rediscovered my love for the hobby after a 27 year break (and after the kids grew up and moved out!) and was amazed at how big the hobby and the community had grown, and just how much more to games and collecting there was out there. I love painting miniatures, sculpting and tabletop gaming with my family and friends, and I love the variety of different projects that come to me to be sculpted. I also have an abundance of ideas that I want to create and have now decided to branch out and create my own miniatures!:::869:::163:::0.31111111111111117:::0.4722222222222222:::4:::2:::2019|||"

In 2007 they made the leap into product creation, design, manufacturing and distribution. In a short time their auto parts, made from t6 6061 billet aluminum, SMD LEDs, and other machined items, found their way into car dealerships and installed on cars in many countries. In 2012 David went back to his roots and started designing simple items that he envisioned being sold all over the world. In just one year he made the move just designing and producing car parts to creating items for the EDC world. Just how do you do that and still pay your bills? In the beginning he worked on both until his skills and popularity grew nationwide and auto parts production and design because history. At this point Qerim is shipping work wide and receving high acclaim for his talent and innovation.

David and Michelle have many years of design and production which is a tremendous help. Their main desire is that people will love and collect their items. Their golden rule is that if it isn’t a quality item they would use and collect then it isn’t offered to the EDC and tool world. We are picky when it comes to products with our name on it and what we offer to our customers. We stand behind our EDC items - if It isn’t right we make it right. We know if it isn’t good we won’t be happy with it and neither will you.

Nels’ premiere album Sunday Shoes continued to find itself in Top Ten albums of the year lists, almost always as the only independent release. His second album, Off Track Betting, received similar critical acclaim, leading to headlining shows at the Paradiso in Amsterdam, and national television broadcast from the legendary Bim Huis in Amsterdam. Nels has shared stages across the US and Europe with the likes of Ramblin’ Jack Elliot, Dick Gaughan, Slaid Cleaves, and The Tallest Man on Earth , main stage performances at Kerrville, Telluride, and twice on the main stage at Holland's TakeRoot festival, The Big Big Country festival in Glasgow, Scotland, and The Orange/Vodaphone Evolution festival in Newcastle, England.:::1354:::221:::0.14404761904761904:::0.3699404761904762:::2:::21:::2010|||"

After she finished drawing and editing the video in her college class, she hid the vhs tape in a drawer because she was ashamed of the anger she expressed. A few years later, she dusted it off to try to make something of it. She added 4 more episodes to her first video and had a lightbulb idea to make t-shirts with ALAG on it. She sold the shirts out of the trunk of her car and sold out by word of mouth. This prompted her to launch her website www.AngryLittleAsianGirl.com in 1998 in order to sell her shirts online and to have an outlet to self-publish her weekly comic. She tried to get ALAG into the mainstream, but she was met with rejection and naysayers who told her, ""there's no market for Asians."" While selling shirts out of her car, she noticed a lot of women from different backgrounds shared her experience of suppressed anger. So she expanded the name to Angry Little Girls which became the umbrella name for her comic strip world. In 2003, she started her own corporation, Angry Little Girls, Inc., so she could license her art to merchandise companies. Her merchandise line was sold in malls all over America and her first book was finally published in April 2005. Just two months later, her first book went into its' fourth printing. The Angry Little Girls books have been translated into Korean, French, and German.:::1538:::277:::-0.06546474358974358:::0.3694444444444444:::1:::1:::2019|||"

"817424348:::1144812331:::brent dewstow-newitt:::The label was established in 2018 as a means to release the back catalogue of renowned Jungle Techno label Underdog Recordings, which ran from 1993-1995. It quickly expanded from beyond the original goal and now reissues sought after, rare and classic records from the Jungle, Rave, Bleep House, Techno and Jungle Techno genres.

The Vinyl Fanatiks aim is to track down and work with the original artists from the early 1990’s, to reissue their music on vinyl only, and to support the record hunters and vinyl diggers from around the world with quality pressings and superb mastering; a way to show respect and share the story of those that created these incredible records.

The vision is not to focus on the obvious artists of that time but to dig a little deeper and find those that came and went but their legacy still holds true to this day. Some of these producers only released one record and vanished soon after but their music still resonates into the 21st century, accumulating new audiences across the globe, far beyond the catchment of the UK pirate radios and muddy fields of 25 years ago. What happened to these artists? Its Vinyl Fanatik’s mission to find out!

Each record captures a moment in time, a vibe that was true and innocent from a period when music was far more synonymous with rebellion and anarchy than today’s finely polished productions and conformist club pop. This music itself bred on the outskirts of society, fuelled by the passion of the rave, its lineage stemming from the Acid House era of 1988. Often produced on minimal equipment, with minimal skills and knowledge, its audio blueprint transcends to new generations, a rawness that no expensive audio plug in could ever create in this present day.

Vinyl Fanatiks wants to pay homage to these young producers who forged the foundations of the multi-million pound EDM scene we have now. Each of these artists has their own tale to tell, their own memories to share. Limited by their own geographical status within the UK, they somehow still all managed to connect and influence each other, years before the internet, mobile phones and social media that we have today. But the music knew no limits and had no boundaries, transcending generations to this day.

"1093468908:::282198295:::Richard X. Heyman:::Richard X. Heyman -- the veteran singer, songwriter, multi-instrumentalist and DIY recording pioneer -- is a world-class artist whose effortless mastery of popular music idioms is matched by his uncanny knack for infusing classic styles with timeless emotional truths.

Heyman was one of the first “one man band” recording artists, following in the grand tradition of Paul McCartney, Emitt Rhodes and Todd Rundgren. His abilities have won him a fiercely loyal grass-roots fan base and reams of acclaim over the past two and a half decades. Critical praise began with the release of Heyman’s first album Living Room!! which Rolling Stone magazine proclaimed “an undiscovered treasure.” All Music Guide called him “perhaps America’s greatest unsung hero of power pop, a songwriter of uncommon talent and intelligence and a one-man rock band without peer,” while the Hartford Courant proclaimed him to be “a true heir to [Brian] Wilson’s mantle, amid an ocean of pretenders.” Rollingstone.com praised Heyman’s “hooks galore and ebullient melodies, and lyrics revealing the emotional power that pop can pack into its brevity,” while the Chicago Tribune observed, “Heyman creates something fresh from his influences rather than parroting them.” With each new release, the glowing reviews piled up (you can check some of them out at www.richardxheyman.com). As Rolling Stone editor David Wild put it in a piece on Heyman’s fourth album Basic Glee, “rock’n’roll doesn’t get any better than this.”

The lifelong passion for music is what’s driven Heyman since his days growing up in Plainfield, New Jersey. He began playing drums at the age of seven, and was proficient on guitar and piano by his teens. By then, he had already begun writing songs. He has developed a versatile singing voice, which can range from sweet crooning balladeering to balls-to-the-wall rock’n’roll wailing.

Heyman was still in junior high school when he achieved his first taste of rock ’n’ roll notoriety as drummer with the fabled garage band The Doughboys, whose raucous live sets won them a rabid following in the New York/New Jersey area during the second half of the 1960s. The Doughboys recorded a pair of singles for the Bell label, made multiple appearances on the local TV show Disc-O-Teen (emceed by legendary horror-show host Zacherle), shared stages with the likes of the Beach Boys, the Buckinghams, Neil Diamond and the Syndicate of Sound, and served as the house band at the Café Wha? in Greenwich Village during the summer of 1968.

By the time Heyman reemerged as a solo artist in the late 1980s, he’d matured into a singularly distinctive songwriter with an uncanny ability to channel his vintage rock ’n’ roll influences into tunes that are both infectiously catchy and emotionally resonant. Those qualities were prominent on his self-released, home-recorded efforts Actual Size and Living Room!! Both generated considerable critical positive press and music-industry word of mouth, leading to a major-label deal with Sire/Warner Bros., which released the widely acclaimed Hey Man! in 1991.

Recording for a corporate label helped to win Heyman a wider audience and a higher media profile. But it also proved to be a frustrating experience, and it wasn’t long before he was back in indie territory, making and releasing his music on his own terms. His subsequent albums Cornerstone, Basic Glee, Rightovers, Actual Sighs, Intakes, Tiers/And Other Stories, X, and Incognito, as well as the EP Heyman, Hoosier and Herman (with guest vocalist Peter Noone of Herman’s Hermits) chronicled Heyman’s ongoing musical evolution. Heyman also found time to release the career-spanning video retrospective X-Posures, and to pen his first book, the vivid rock ’n’ roll memoir Boom Harangue.

Having recorded within the major-label system and as a self-sufficient free agent, Heyman definitely prefers the latter route. “Back before there were state-of-the-art home recording systems,” he notes, “you had to record in a proper studio if you wanted to make a decent-sounding record. And to afford a good studio, you had to have a record deal. But now you can match the highest paid major-label artist sonically in your bedroom. The cat’s out of the bag now.”

When he hasn’t been writing and recording his own material, Heyman has also found time to work with an array of other artists over the years, including several of his musical heroes. He’s played drums behind Beach Boys mastermind Brian Wilson, seminal guitar icon Link Wray, Left Banke leader Michael Brown and beloved indie troubadour Jonathan Richman. He also served as guitarist in Shangri-Las lead singer Mary Weiss’ band during her recent comeback, and played keyboards with soul legend Ben E. King.

In recent years, Heyman has juggled his own work with his activities as a member of the reactivated Doughboys, who first reunited to play at Heyman’s surprise birthday party in 2000 and have remained active ever since, delivering authentically raw garage rock ’n’ roll to old and new fans. The resurgent quartet has also released a quartet of well-received new albums, 2007’s Is It Now?, 2010’s Act Your Rage, 2012’s Shakin’ Our Souls, 2014's Hot Beat Stew and 2017's Front Street Rebels. Two RXH compositions - Why Can't She See Me? and Sink Or Swim - were chosen as ""Coolest Song in the World"" on Little Steven's Underground Garage Sirius XM channel.

Heyman lives in New York City with his wife Nancy and their beloved cats.:::5485:::957:::0.12116396443544879:::0.37264660252941506:::3:::10:::2011|||"

"152730994:::1760605364:::Grey Fox Games:::Long before we made games, we played them. I have personally enjoyed playing games for as long as I can remember. From board games to video games to pretty much anything that involved the word ""play"", I have always been attracted to gaming. I still remember the day I decided I hated dice rolling games (it involved an ""impossible"" loss in Castle Risk that haunts me to this day). Being a gamer and enjoying this hobby is what drove me to this business. I've always believed in doing what you love and I can't think of anything I'd rather do than work in this industry. As for why Grey Fox Games needs to run a KS. The answer to that is simple. While we have the funds to design a game (art graphics, play testing, etc), the money to actually manufacture and distribute is another story. Making a game is a very lengthy and costly process and without Kickstarter, we would simply be unable to launch many of our ventures.
My commitment is to never publish a game that I myself would not want to play (I've sort of come to terms with that Castle Risk loss after 30 years, so dice may very well show up in our titles). I truly feel that we have something to offer and we hope that after you've played our games, you'll feel the same way.

"613777046:::518027733:::Dago Red:::“Cicada” their fourth and new album has been produced by Angelo Scogno, published by mrm Appaloosa and distributed by IRD, it’s an elegant journey and a complete art project, an exiting music experiment: from blues to folk to americana including a traditional southern italian marching band. Every cd cover is a unique piece.

All originally from Abruzzo Italy Dago Red started as a buskers trio in 1998 when Nicola Palanza, Marco Pellegrini and Giuseppe Mascitelli met with their instruments and their voices and the desire to play the blues. Since the very beginning they had the gift of a catchy and recognizable sound.

Twenty years, 4 original records, tracks included in collections and documentaries, buckets of songs and hundreds of gigs.

Later the band is enriched with new components, without loosing the quality of their own sound, enriching their color palette with: Nicola Di Camillo on the bass and doublebass, Paola Ceroli on the voice, Angelo Scogno on the keyboards and the voice and Andrea Giovannoli on the drums and percussions.

Their vocal harmoines, guitar plots, moving grooves, natural sound, make their concerts, as the French magazine “Le Blues” says a “coup de coeur” (a heart stroke).

They’ve thrilled their audiences in France, Germany, England Scotland, Switzerland and Italy of course.

In 2012 they won the italian blues competition and were nominated the best Italian blues band and in 2013 they represented Italy at the european blues challenge in Berlin. They had a special mention at the “International Songwriting Competition, two of the jury were Tom Waits and Robert Smith.

Their records transpire of a unique style. Listening to them, is like travelling with on a train while the songs / stories flowing out the window. Their tracks are full of nuances and sounds that suddenly overwelm you.:::1849:::308:::0.2514260739260739:::0.47207958707958714:::1:::0:::2019|||"

""I work slow and easily fall prey to getting caught up in the smallest of details. I enjoy the process of revealing the stories behind the characters and couldn't imagine working any other way."" Smith spends countless hours in his studio ""playing"" with new materials and technique to use in his work. Some of his most successful and unexpected pieces have been created by just letting his imagination run. Making up stories and giving life to inanimate objects was a childhood pastime for Smith, which has turned into a successful career. He admits to an overactive imagination resulting in a cast of curious creatures featured in several books and magazines. Though it may sound a bit crazy, his spirited characters have become his day-to-day friends in the studio. Smith no longer views them as relating to a particular season or holiday, but more as just a very diverse group of playmates - some are pushy, while others are shy. Either way, he keeps his eyes peeled, as these eccentric companions are mischievous and can cause quite a ""ruckus"" in the workplace.:::1545:::265:::0.15407925407925407:::0.5336829836829836:::1:::0:::2015|||"

I have a background in directing theatre, but my days are now dedicating to educating teenagers. My artistic focus has shifted largely to writing poetry. In all of my work, I seek to be a humble, lighthearted, uplifting listener. I have been reading tarot for nearly six years. It all started in my college apartment, where my friends and I would read from tarot books to interpret the cards. As time passed, I began to read tarot for friends and strangers. My understanding of tarot evolved to include poetry when I co-created a ritualistic theatre experience called Arcana Obscura with the illustrator of this book, Cassie Bowers. This is my tarot philosophy: take what is useful, let whatever revelations arise influence you, and leave behind or ignore whatever does not resonate. You have complete freedom to make your participation in tarot as clinical, spiritual, or raucous as you like.

"1004922726:::753739399:::Corey Harris:::Corey Harris is a guitarist, vocalist, songwriter and band leader who has carved out his own niche in blues. A powerful singer and accomplished guitarist, he has appeared at venues throughout North America, Europe, Brazil, The Caribbean, West Africa, Asia, Australia and New Zealand. He began his career as a New Orleans street singer, travelling throughout the southern U.S. In his early twenties he lived in Cameroon, West Africa for a year, which had a profound effect on his later work. He has recorded many old songs of the blues tradition while also creating an original vision of the blues by adding influences from reggae, soul, rock and West African music. His 1995 recording, Between Midnight and Day, is a tribute to the tradition of acoustic blues. Subsequent recordings, such as Greens From the Garden (1999), Mississippi to Mali (2003), and Daily Bread (2005) show Harris' maturation from interpreter to songwriter. Some of his imaginative compositions are marked by a deliberate eclecticism; other works stay true to the traditional blues formula of compelling vocals and down-home guitar. He has performed, recorded, and toured with many of the top names in music such as BB King, Taj Mahal, Buddy Guy, Henry Butler, R.L.Burnside, John Jackson, Ali Farka Toure, Boubacar Traore, Dave Mattews Band, Tracy Chapman, Olu Dara, Wilco, Natalie Merchant, and others. His additional recordings include Fish Ain't Bitin' (1996), Vu-Du Menz (with Henry Butler, 2000), Downhome Sophisticate (2002), Zion Crossroads (2007) and blu black (2010).

In 2003 Harris was a featured artist and narrator of the Martin Scorcese film, ""Feel Like Going Home,"" which traced the evolution of blues from West Africa to the southern U.S. In the film, he interviews and performs with Ali Farka Toure and Mississippi fife and drum player Othar Turner, among others. Harris has published articles with the Oxford American and Living Blues magazine.:::1936:::310:::0.11969211344211342:::0.3387529137529137:::3:::5:::2011|||"

"2060327536:::1067471183:::CappuccinoBrown:::In March 2015, I was in my senior year of college and preparing for graduation. I was also coming off my second collegiate indoor national title for my University's track & field team. This was a dream that I saw so vividly going all the way back to when I was a young boy. Life was running pretty smoothly at that moment (no pun intended).

On March 24, 2015, my life took a drastic turn for worse. While training for one of my highly competitive track meets, I found out my mother was viciously murdered at work. Needless to say, my family and I were devastated. I began to spiral rapidly into the lowest, darkest time in my life. I couldn’t quite grasp that something of this nature could happen to someone I held so dearly to my heart. My mother was my confidant, consultant, and friend. I didn’t know who to talk to or turn to for help.

I was only out of school for 2 weeks before returning in order to stay on task. My body was present, but my spirit was not. However, I was determined to graduate and finish my remaining time as an athlete, as I knew she would’ve wanted. Returning to track enabled my solace and saved me from a vicious city. St. Louis no longer had that same soothing effect for me. I struggled through my senior season but did not function at my potential. I was disoriented, depressed, and detached.

One year later, I moved to Los Angeles but was uncertain about my direction. In high school, I was always the “Funny Guy” and “life of the party”. I even won the “Funniest Person” superlative from my classmates. Unfortunately, after the loss of my mother, I lost that spark and humor for life that so many people (including my mom) had come to know me for. Amazingly, while being lost in such a big city, I was actually able to find myself. It was also during this period when I had my first run-in with a comedy club. That allowed me to see the meaning of my situation. I saw the joy one joke could bring to so many strangers. This helped me to feel again. The spark of laughter slowly began pulling me out of my sorrow. Comedy quickly became the therapy that reignited my award-winning humor which for a time had almost completely dwindled away. Track allowed me to travel and see the world, as well as give me a broadened viewpoint. Finding comedy showed me how to communicate that voice. In the three year span following my mother's untimely death, I graduated college with Bachelor of Science in Mass Communications, landed internships/jobs with top media entities, had leading roles in nationally airing commercials, as well as numerous television appearances. All of that is fantastic, but nothing has been as therapeutic as the moments live comedy has provided for me, even if only for a moment. I want to share that with the world! My aim is to grow this event and create many more moments for those of us who need comedic relief, thus… Good Funny Live!

All we have are moments, let’s share some!:::2943:::551:::0.004061447811447814:::0.3333217592592593:::1:::0:::2019|||"

"1968639454:::1782986647:::Ernie Hendrickson:::Six years after releasing his 2013 Nashville-recorded album One for the Dreamers, Americana singer-songwriter and guitarist Ernie Hendrickson returns to his Chicago home with Roll On, his most mature, observant and musically wide ranging collection

CHICAGO--It was six years ago that Ernie Hendrickson, who was born in the Wisconsin region known as the Driftless Area and raised in Illinois, released his last album, One for the Dreamers. Hendrickson, who recorded One for the Dreamers in the fabled city of Nashville with producer Chad Cromwell and a cast of musicians that included legendary Willie Nelson harmonica wizard Mickey Raphael and harmony singer Lera Lynn, took away the myriad lessons of Music City, and the record displayed his songwriting savvy, guitar acumen and feel for the American language. But Hendrickson regrouped, and changed, after his Nashville experience, which found him spending time in the city while returning home to Chicago. The results of his newfound maturity are evident on his new album Roll On, which he recorded in his home town with producer Brian Deck, himself known for giving a sonic sheen to records by Iron & Wine and Counting Crows. In addition, Hendrickson made the call to record Roll On live off the floor with a group of sympathetic musicians, with minimal overdubs. He performed the vocals live in the control booth, giving the album an energetic, unstudied feel that gains power from Deck’s immaculate production. It’s a triumphant return for one of Americana’s finest singers and songwriters. Roll On displays Ernie’s ability to tackle weighty themes with humor and a sharp eye for the details that make his songs humane and compelling. Influenced by everyone from Jerry Garcia and Robert Hunter to Nashville humorist and songwriter Todd Snider, Ernie wrote a set of songs for Roll On that address the commercialization and alienation of American life. One song, “Dystopian Dreams,” makes explicit the looming political and social crises that characterize American life in 2019, but he gives the song an optimistic spin that comes from his new role as father to a young daughter, and as a family man who likes to spend time at home when he’s not on the road doing what musicians do to make a living. It’s a diverse set of songs, with the opener, “Do It for Love,” describing a normal day in the life of a city-dweller and turning it into an affirmation of the mundane joys of taking the train and shopping at your favorite record store. The Roy Orbison-style song “One Day of Life” folds in everyday hassles like traffic jams and checkout lines, but Ernie remains happy about the transitory joys of life. With Brian Deck spurring Ernie to refine his songwriting--one song, “New Midwestern Winter Blues,” was begun in 2013 during a particularly challenging Chicago winter and finished five years later as the album began to be recorded--Roll On is the apotheosis of the art of a great American songwriter. The album has its heavy themes, too, as in “Standing Like a Rock,” in which he sings: “They want it all/And they’re coming for it/Sucking the life out of the land/It’s way past time to make a stand.” It’s a crunching riff-rocker in the tradition of John Mellencamp or Bruce Springsteen, with touches of Todd Snider evident in its sardonic approach.

Ably aided by guitarist and pedal steel player Brian Wilkie, bassist Pete Muschong, drummer Gerald Dowd and keyboardist John Kattke, Hendrickson plays biting electric guitar and beautifully phrased acoustic on Roll On. The Randy Newman-meets-Dixieland horn arrangements are by Matt Ulery, who is Ernie’s brother-in-law. The album covers a lot of ground, and gives a portrait of a Midwestern reality that Ernie knows first-hand. It’s his most far-ranging work to date, and proves that going home is always a possibility when you’re as grounded and observant as Ernie Hendrickson. Ernie Hendrickson is, as you will hear when you give Roll On a listen, one of American music’s bright lights. He’s illuminated his way throughout his career, and Roll On shines a light into areas that in other hands would remain shrouded in darkness. He’s grown exponentially since his last album, and Roll On is a testament to what maturity means when it co-exists with the yearning to describe the truth that the best American artists have always sought, in their own ways.:::4368:::767:::0.20248556998556996:::0.3738852813852813:::2:::10:::2012|||"

About 1 year ago my then 6 year old son Max said he wanted to start his own business making American Flags out of wood. Being that he has had a love for our Old Glory his entire life and even started saluting her at 2 years old, I was not all that surprised. What did surprise me was his use of his resources, his Mom and me. I am a finished carpenter and my wife an artist. When Max asked me to ""help"" him start his business he said, ""Daddy you can build the flags from wood, and Mommy and do artwork on them"". Almost immediately I saw the opportunity. My wife and I started to com up with Flag designs that included our flag with patriotically themed artwork. It wasn't long before Max started pushing us to make flags that really began to challenge our skills. Our ""Waving"" and ""Back-lit"" flags are great examples of that.
Today 1 year later we have left our old day jobs and are working for Max full time, and have now sold over 400 flags!:::1042:::202:::0.12751893939393938:::0.1947727272727273:::1:::0:::2019|||"

"1400345098:::1192936348:::Jake Hoot:::Don’t let his larger-than-life presence fool you. Jake Hoot may stand at 6’6”, but he is one of the most sweet-natured and genuine folks anyone could ever hope to meet, and his heart shines through in his delivery of authentic, melodic, straight-from-the-soul music. Jake was born in Texas, but being the 2nd child of 9 siblings born to Baptist missionaries, he’s lived a quite unique and an adventurous life. In addition to his red dirt roots, his family has lived Oklahoma and Haiti, but most of his childhood was spent in the Dominican Republic. In his late teens, Jake and his family relocated just outside of Nashville to Cookeville, TN, where he attended and played football for Tennessee Tech University. It was during his college tenure that he began playing regular gigs at local restaurants and college bars, and also where he began to find his groove. “Growing up, I was always a huge fan of classic country and rock, but having lived in the Dominican, I think there’s a little bit of an island feel to my music as well.” Jake also says he has a soft spot for harmonies, which he attributes to his favorite band, The Eagles. Since he began playing those college bar gigs, Jake’s musical style and presence are ever-evolving. He’s had the privilege of opening for some of Country Music’s biggest names, including Love and Theft, Wade Hayes, Lila McCann, Bryan White, Chris Lane, and Trent Tomlinson to name a few. Jake is currently writing new music and performing. Stay up to date on Jake Hoot by following him on Facebook and Instagram at @JakeHootMusic.:::1566:::288:::0.10051652892561984:::0.28400614536978175:::1:::2:::2019|||"
"361357876:::1669799592:::Jeremy Smith:::Hi, I’m Jeremy Smith. Creating simple solutions to common pain points through product design has always been a passion of mine. I always knew that when I grew up I wanted to be an “inventor”. Rain is the second company I have started with my long time business partner Sean. Before Rain, we started a company called SnapPower. SnapPower’s focus is to create better lighting solutions for our homes. We launched our first product in 2014 on Kickstarter and raised enough money to get it to market several months later. Since that initial Kickstarter project, we have done two additional projects which have all funded and shipped successfully. Since then, SnapPower has shipped its innovative products to hundreds of thousands of customers.

I am very excited to be bringing another product to Kickstarter in hopes of getting this product to market within the next couple of months. With your support, we can finally have straws that are both clean AND reusable. In doing so we can protect both our health and the beautiful earth we call home.

Sandy Steen Bartholomew is an author, illustrator, mixed-media artist, and a Certified Zentangle® Teacher, creative single mom, grown-up gifted-kid and major introvert. She graduated from RISD, '92/IL and runs an art studio (Beez Ink), a teaching studio and shop (The BeeHive), and an Etsy store (Bumblebat). Her life looks like a Zentangle!

Sandy is inspired by juicy, jewel-tones and rusty-crusty, peeling, earth-covered things. Magic, mystery, and weird little creatures. If it sits still, she'll paint it.

When she does venture out of her bat-cave, she enjoys overwhelming people with possibilities, laughing until it hurts, and drawing on walls.
Sandy lives with her two kids and a cat in their colorful, mixed-media house in New Hampshire.

Although I intended to be Indiana Jones when I grew up, I dropped out of archaeology when I discovered I'd have to learn not only French, German and Arabic, but hieratic, demotic hierogyphics and 1920's scholarly British. I really just liked to draw the glyphs! So I went to art school. Two art schools. Where I learned to draw like other people and completely forgot who I was or wanted to be. I did freelance illustration for years, started and sold a rubber stamp company. Started another one. Started a very cool store called Wingdoodle. Got certified to teach Zentangle. Taught Zentangle. Wrote a whole bunch of books. And then I started over completely - I went back to school for my Masters in Applied Cartooning.:::1713:::278:::0.08274363533292105:::0.28793702329416615:::6:::15:::2012|||"

"1215805427:::1862068705:::A K Nicholas:::I am A K Nicholas, a visual artist specializing in figure (fine art nudes) photography. I produce coffee table style photobooks that showcase images, organized into themes with brief essays that introduce each section. limited edition archival photographs are available, with typically 25 or fewer impressions per edition. I also offer free, monthly online exhibits.

Your support not only gets you great rewards but allows the models and myself to continue creating the artwork you love. I am grateful for the reception I have received from Kickstarter. The community's support has been life changing for me. I am in my sixth year as a full-time artist.

I became interested in art through museum visits and other cultural experiences in Europe, America, Africa, and Asia. Growing up the Middle East, women’s bodies were hidden from public view; in stark contrast, Europeans mostly lacked prudishness. Compare those to America, where we have a bifurcated culture: half of us celebrate our beauty while the other half shuns it.

My initial training with the nude was figure drawing while studying art in college, but I knew that photography would be my medium of choice. I got my art degree from Fort Lewis College in Durango CO. After college, I supported myself by clerking and working the darkroom of a photography store. Soon after I became a freelance artist and professional photographer. I went back to school and got an MBA and tried a few different things, including managing corporate project teams and even getting licensed as a stockbroker for a while. But art kept calling me. A few years back I quit my day job. I don't shoot weddings, real estate, or events. I just shoot for my artwork. I make my own sets and props and am constantly scouting locations and subjects.

It’s almost never my intent for my photographs to be a technical tour de force. I prefer to celebrate my subject rather than flatter. Often the work is about beauty, but there are other themes at play, too.

"1186966144:::120723716:::David Rose:::David Charles is the founder and CEO of House of David Rose llc. David was raised in a single parent household with help from a hardworking grandmother. Although, his mother struggled she made it seem effortless to provide for her children. She made sure that David and his siblings had food, shelter, clothing, and a close relationship with each side of the family. At thirteen, David learned the value of a dollar in a community summer youth program working as a Detroit Police Cadet. From that point on he continued working various jobs while in high school to earn money. At the age of nineteen, David and his family were shocked when they were informed that his mother had to have multiple emergency brain surgeries due to aneurysms (a fluid-filled sac in the wall of an artery that can weaken the wall). That moment fueled David to work vigorously on a course of action to provide for his mother and family.

As an adult David worked multiple jobs at a time caring for individuals who have disabilities and cleaning buildings for a janitorial service for many years. He eventually landed a job in the technology industry where he learned a lot of essential information. Then, in 2012 David presented a few clothing designs in a fashion runway show and fell in love with the thought of building the David Rose brand. In 2016, David had an idea to create the David Rose Smart Handbag. He wrote a business plan, had it reviewed by a business consultant, registered for patent pending status, and researched the development process to produce the product. Now, that this amazing opportunity with Kickstarter has been presented David's dreams are finally unfolding and he is extremely grateful for Kickstarter and the backers supporting the David Rose Smart Handbag project.

He co-founded Nunkie Theatre Company in 1996 to produce shows on the London Fringe – among them Alan Bennett’s An Englishman Abroad, Patrick Suskind’s The Double Bass, and David Mamet’s Squirrels.

It was while working at the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge that he rediscovered a love of the works of Montague Rhodes James, the master of the English ghost story. In 2005 he dusted off the Nunkie brand and performed A Pleasing Terror, the first of five one-man shows based on James’s tales. He has since toured these extensively around the UK, USA and Ireland. On Christmas Day 2013 he appeared as M R James in Ghost Writer, Mark Gatiss’s BBC 2 documentary about the life of the author.

In Summer 2014 he toured a one man adaptation of The Time Machine around the UK. This was commissioned in 2012 by the Lowry, as part of their ‘in development…’ scheme for emerging theatre companies. It premiered in the studio there in 2013, and subsequently toured nationally.

Other works for Nunkie include Blood, Bone and Genius, a one-man play based on the diaries of the 19th century painter Benjamin Robert Haydon, which was performed in the Royal Academy Schools; and A Night in the Fitzwilliam, a children’s show commissioned by the Fitzwilliam Museum for performance by torchlight in the galleries. Robert has also released audiobooks: Curious Creatures – The Shorter Horror of M R James and Two Strange Tales Lucy Boston. In his spare time he tinkers with the extensive notes he has made for a book about the life and stories of M R James.:::1708:::306:::0.01875:::0.23333333333333336:::4:::4:::2012|||"

"161525821:::1008093313:::Elizabeth Williams:::Growing up as a homeschool kid, I already knew I was different. That was reenforced when I started my adult life as a missionary, going around the world teaching people how to use microphones correctly, and playing music for anyone who would listen. I worked on church worship teams for 19 years, as back up vocalist, keyboard player, and worship leader. But Just Shy of 20 years, the constant drama and resistance to my style of leading took it's toll and I called it quits on music in the church...and the church...and maybe even on God, jury is still out there. Meanwhile, I married Mr. Tall Dark & Handsome in 2008 and had four kiddos, back to back. When it was time to start their proper education, Mr. Handsome told me if I wanted to homeschool, I could, if that's how I wanted to spend my time. (He is the main bread winner.) I jumped in and have really loved it! We are 4 years in and I don't plan on stopping any time soon. I'm also the queen of side gigs. I've been giving piano lessons since 2010, became a consultant for a children's book publisher in 2015, started tuning pianos in 2018, and became a member of my husband's roundtable podcast in 2018.

"774841427:::110473315:::Kolelinia:::Here’s a brief intro to who we are and what drives us, apart from the Halfbike. Martin & Mihail are architects and true partners in crime who share a vision for a better world and truly believe less is more. They stay guided by their passion for the outdoors and core belief that we, humans, are born to move. So, when everything becomes too complicated, we need to push hard on that reset button and get our personal time offline.

Driven mostly by our curiosity about alternative transport systems we had a wild idea to create a new vehicle from scratch, using left-over bicycle parts that dusted in the attic for ages. But what started from a toy to play around with, evolved into a real product.

Ever since the very first prototypes we felt the Halfbike idea was revolutionary. But an idea is worth nothing until brought to life, right? What looked like a real product back in 2014 greatly evolved during the last five years. Only with the support from our first backers did we manage to start this adventure and learn the craft of making bicycles. Today, thousands of people in 90 countries ride the Halfbike and keep on sending ideas and recommendations, urging us to improve. We grow together. Packed with all the feedback we received and with our personal experience, we went back to the drawing board one more time. We’re excited to say that the Halfbike is now complete and that the user experience has finally been perfected. So now, it is as good as it was in our wildest dreams. :)

Through the years and along with the Halfbike, our team grew steadily. We believe that hacking the well established order, with small but confident steps, can make our future brighter. We believe in local manufacturing - it is our way of keeping our business fair and sustainable. That’s why each Halfbike is handmade in our workshop in Europe. But there is more. We chose to work only with direct customers. This helps us grow together and the feedback from our clients keeps us up-to-date and on track. Kickstarter taught us an important lesson, one we always get back to. “Listen!”. We are devoted to keeping this direct communication and it truly means a lot to us. The good vibes flows both ways. The result is the best Halfbike possible, straight from our workshop to your home, without involving any middlemen and the complexity they bring. That simple. *** P.S. So you got this far? :) There is one more thing we’d love to share with you. Our hectic life and the urging need for a reset were the inspiration for the short movie below. It explains what we believe in and the philosophy that sparked the Halfbike project in the first place. Enjoy it!

"191367761:::1836924379:::Magnus Macdonald:::Okay, so the slightly-curious part of you wants to know more about me? Well okay.

Here's the down-and-dirty...

I am the self-professed ""King of Quality"". I have little time for products (or services for that matter) that are anything but the best.

I'm no billionaire...

And because I'm not a billionaire yet - then I really can't afford the ""best"" of everything in all things. However, I make sure, for what my finances allow - I BUY THE BEST I CAN AFFORD RIGHT NOW!

When I was a kid...

I used to build, make and modify things in our garden shed. In fact, I can't even own a simple ball-point pen without modifying it (it's usually only a matter of minutes before it's in pieces and I'm making the spring stronger or ""improving"" it in some other way...).

I think it's hereditary...

My grandfather, in the days when cars were rare where he lived, was not content with just having a petrol car - he built some whacky gadget to make the thing run on butane-type gas! (we're talking decades before LPG even came on the scene)

In fact, I'm convinced it's hereditary...

My Father runs not only his car - but the hot water and heating in his entire house - on vegetable oil! (you gotta see it - it'll blow your mind)

Genetics or not...

This combination of only accepting the best in life - together with the inventive/innovative streak that runs through my family - has ultimately led me to start designing and making products that I believe are truly the best money can buy.

So... has this little ""bio"" given you some insight into who I am? I hope so.

Now it's up to YOU...

Join me in ridding the world of poor-quality, sub-standard products...

If you're reading this - there's a good chance I currently have a Kickstarter Campaign running. If I do - then you can bet your bottom dollar that it's some ridiculously high-quality, Magnus-must-be-insane product.

If you've backed it - thank you! I promise, hand-on-heart, that you will love what you've backed. If you've not backed it - then you really need to decide whether you want the best in life - I'm as serious as a heart attack!

Here's the thing...

Kickstarter is what allows someone like me (who has bucket-loads of ideas, passion, drive and purpose) to take the ""leap"" from late-night, kitchen-table, back-of-the-envelope type designing and building ...to reaching the ""next level"" and put my ideas in your hands (literally!).

I look forward to shipping my next product to you!

"1917199946:::120171736:::Alicia Maher:::The production was South Pacific. In a small secluded theater, located in the town of Volcano, I experienced my first theatrical performance. This dramatization was the catalyst which ignited a pre-existing active fascination with the arts, which led to a personal and professional conquest toward a series of interrelated fields.

Growing up on the Big Island of Hawaii, I was immersed in an educational environment dedicated to the cultivation of traditional Hawaiian hula and music as a cultural art form. I continued my education at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, through which I was able to continue my pursuit of music and the performing arts with an internship at The Harbour Agency in Sydney, Australia. This was a concert booking agency dedicated to small musical acts across the country. Over the next several years, I was driven to venture across the United States to pursue working for firms that matched my goal to continue in the music and theatrical world. I worked in public relations specializing in entertainment client initiatives, events and publicity at the firm Elevate Communications in Boston, Massachusetts. Next, I was back on the Big Island of Hawaii where my understanding of people was broadened by working with a team at the Four Seasons Resort Hualalai as a Concierge.

My next endeavor was working for the President and Chief of Staff alongside the board members of New England Conservatory of Music in Boston, Massachusetts. New England Conservatory was a strong turning point as I was introduced to the El Sistema concept. El Sistema was founded in Venezuela with the goal of bringing music and performance education to underrepresented and impoverished children. New England Conservatory implemented this concept with the education of Sistema Fellows, a group of select students who strove to create their own programs across the United States which connected youth development through music with social change. I would like to continue in the effort of changing lives for the better.:::2036:::326:::0.11864177489177488:::0.28297258297258293:::1:::0:::2019|||"

"1943996630:::1621866563:::Susanna Fields-Kuehl, LGPC, NCC:::Growing up as an only child, I developed a rich inner life full of curiosity and fantastical worlds. I could always be found with a book or crayon in hand. At the age of 10, I added quilting and embroidery to my palette, with the inspiration of my grandmother and aunt. By age 13, I had written and illustrated 18 books. Telling stories through words and pictures was a place where I could truly be me.

As an adult, I seek to transform the depths of everyday experiences into imaginative and beautiful worlds of opportunity and hope through the art of children’s picture books and experimental mixed textile works. I hold both a Master of Arts degree in Mental Health Counseling from Bowie State University and the History of Decorative Arts from the Corcoran College of Art & Design/The Smithsonian Associates. I integrate my love of art with helping children and adults in my work as a professional counselor. Through my children's books, I hope other children can find connections to their own life, comfort that they are not alone, acceptance of their and other’s uniqueness, and joy in finding their own creative path to self-expression.:::1145:::200:::0.10907407407407407:::0.2559259259259259:::1:::0:::2019|||"

"1027107105:::632055929:::Aaron Cain:::Dear Customer,

My name is Aaron Cain. I have been a wood worker since 2001 and an gaming enthusiast since 1993. I started my wood working journey shortly after college and marriage to my wonderful wife Heather. We were poor homeowners with not very much furniture and it seemed pointless to buy lower quality furniture that would ultimately break soon after it was purchased. I set my goal of designing and building every piece of furniture in our home with an expectation of it becoming an antique that could be passed down to our children.

In 2011 a friend inquired about the construction of some simple deck boxes to store MTG cards. Since all of the furniture was complete and I still had a garage full of tools, Soon after your ideas for new boxes started flooding in and some of those ideas have also become part of what I offer.

My goal is the same as it was when I started this adventure, ""Build every box with the expectation of it becoming an antique, that can be passed down to others.""

Thank you for your support,

I began writing when I was a nine or ten. The first thing that inspired me to pick up a pen was the book Dragonheart by Charles Edward Pogue, but it was Star Wars that kept me writing. After years of writing painfully awful fan fictions I weaned myself off them and began writing my own stories. During a particularly long drought I stopped writing until a very dear friend encouraged me to try NaNoWriMo. That was the first time I ever finished a book and because of that my love of writing was revitalized. With new confidence and goals I’ve been plodding along ever since. It wasn’t until a year or so ago that I read a compelling article about indie publishing, which got me to think differently about my goals. It’s been a steep learning curve and a bit of a struggle, but this is a path I’m excited to walk.:::1048:::211:::0.16774080086580087:::0.5030844155844156:::2:::14:::2014|||"

"1064341591:::717485243:::Thomas Doll - Thomarillion:::Deutsch:
Im Jahr 2003 begann der eigentliche Gründer von Thomarillion, Thomas Reinheckel (heute bei www.brickerium.de) damit, Modelle für Tabletop-Spiele auf Ebay zu verkaufen. Seine Arbeiten kamen gut an und so beschloss er, das Ganze professioneller aufzuziehen und die Kreationen auch über eine eigene Webseite zu verkaufen, die ich (Thomas ""Thommy"" Doll) im Frühjahr 2004 für ihn erstellte. Durch den Verkauf der Modelle bei Ebay entstand auch der Kontakt zum ersten Thomarillion-Modellierer Thomas ""Tom"" Kramme. Als dann noch ein weiterer Modellierer namens Thomas Maier hinzu kam, war der Name ""Thomarillion"" fast schon logische Konsequenz, da unser aller Herz auch für die Werke von J.R.R. Tolkien (""Silmarillion"") schlug. So war auch die erste Veranstaltung bei der sich Thomarillion der Öffentlichkeit präsentierte das Mitgliedertreffen des Herr der Ringe Tabletop Forums (www.tabletop-hdr.de) in Bad Kreuznach, im Januar 2005. Im selben Jahr besuchten wir die ""DUZI"" in Wesel und die Messe ""SPIEL"" in Essen, auf der auch der Kontakt zur Firma Ziterdes entstand. Seit Januar 2006 ist Thomarillion ein auf mich, Thomas Doll, angemeldetes Gewerbe und nachdem wir über die Jahre von zwischenzeitlich fünf Mitgliedern namens Thomas auf die beiden Gründer geschrumpft waren, wurde mein Arbeitsbereich immer mehr erweitert. Angefangen bei der Erstellung und Betreuung der Webseite, sowie der Präsenz auf den Messen, kamen zuerst Bemalung und Geländebau hinzu und nachdem meine ersten Modellierversuche fruchteten, übernahm ich auch diesen Bereich. Thomas war bei meinen Modellierversuchen immer sehr kritisch und wenn mal ein Möbelstück etwas schief geraten war, bekam ich das immer lange vorgehalten. Das änderte sich erst, nach dem meinen Entwürfen auf einer Messe ""Charme"" attestiert wurde. Seit dem sind kleine Schönheitsfehler keine Fehler mehr sondern erzeugten ""Charme"" ;-) Obwohl unser Einstieg der Bereich Tabletop und hier die Welt des ""Der Herr der Ringe"" war, versuchten wir recht bald auch andere Bereiche mit Artikeln bedienen zu können, hier vor Allem den Bereich ""Dungeoncrawler"" (""Hero Quest"" war übrigens unsere ""Einstiegsdroge"") aber auch den Dioramenbau. Unsere Philosophie war die Artikel möglichst universell einsetzbar zu gestalten und uns nicht auf ein bestimmtes Spiel(esystem) festlegen zu lassen und den Preis so günstig zu halten, dass sich ein Selbstbauen kaum lohnt. Relativ früh mussten wir allerdings erkennen, dass der Bau und der Verkauf von fertigen Modellen zwar Spaß macht, der Stundenlohn hierfür aber weit von dem entfernt ist, was diese Arbeit zu einem Beruf machen könnte. So verkauften wir ab 2007 keine fertigen Modelle mehr, sondern nur noch die Abgüsse unserer Master. Viele der Artikel produzierten wir selbst in Keramik, hatten aber auch schon extern produzierte Artikel aus Metall und Hartschaum, sowie ein paar gelaserte Holzbausätze im Sortiment. Die Zusammenarbeit mit Ziterdes wurde über die Jahre stetig intensiviert, so modellierte anfänglich nur Thomas Reinheckel Neuheiten für die Firma aus Wangen aber bereits seit Mitte 2006 auch ich. Thomas entwarf übrigens auch ""Dunkelstadt"", ein modulares 3D-Dungeonsystem, das im Jahr seines Erscheinens (2008) von ModelFan zum Modell des Jahres gekürt wurde. Im Jahr 2010 beschlossen wir dann, die Produktion in Keramik auf ein paar Artikel, bei denen das wirklich Sinn machte, zu reduzieren und liessen den großen Rest auch extern und nun in Resin herstellen. 2010 war auch das Jahr des großen Umbruchs, denn Thomas Reinheckel zog sich zurück und seit dem ist Thomarillion eine ""One-man-show"". Seit dem versuche ich das Sortiment stetig zu erweitern und die Welt der Tabletoper, Dungeonspieler und Dioramenbauer mit meinem ""charmanten"" Krimskrams zu erfreuen. _________________
English:
In the year 2003 the founder of Thomarillion Thomas Reinheckel (today at www.brickerium.de) started with selling models for tabletop games at ebay. People liked his work and so he decided to make it more professional and to sell his creations on an own website too. This site was launched by me (Thomas ""Thommy"" Doll) in spring 2004.

Selling items on ebay was the reason for the contact with the first Thomarillion-sculpter Thomas ""Tom"" Kramme. After a second sculpter, Thomas Maier, joined it was a logical consequence to name the project ""Thomarillion"". We all were very fond of the books of J.R.R.Tolkien (""Silmarillion""). The first event Thomarillion appeared in public was the member meeting of the german Lord of the Rings forum (www.tabletop-hdr.de) in Bad Kreuznach in January 2005. In the same year we visited ""DUZI"" in Wesel and the fair ""SPIEL"" in Essen, wher we made contact to Ziterdes (www.ziterdes.de).

Since January 2006 Thomarillion is my own registered business and after all of the meanwhile five Thomas left except of the two founders, my field of work grew more and more.

Starting with building and administrating the website and presence at fairs I also made paintjobs and terrainbuilding. After the first successful sculpting attempts that was the next part of my work at Thomarillion. We weren't able to afford external sculptors anyway ;-)

Thomas was very critical with my sculpts and when a master turned out to be somekind of skew he objected that for a long time. That changed when a customer told him that he likes the Thomarillon stuff so much because the designs had ""Charm"". Since then little flaws were no mistakes but generated charm ;-)

Although we started with tabletop and especially ""The Lord of the rings"", we soon tried to feed other branches of the hobby too, mainly the area of ""Dungeon-crawler"" (""Hero Quest"" was our starter drug by the way) but also for showcase builders.

Our philosophy was to create items that can be used in many purposes and not for a certain gaming-system. The price should be as low as possible, so people rather buy at Thomarillion then doing things by themselves.

Unfortunately we had to learn that creating and selling finished terrain pieces or models is fun but not suitable for doing it professional as a job. The hourly wage was too low.

So we stopped selling finished models in 2007 and sold only casts of our masters from them on. Most of our items were made of ceramic (produced by ourselves) but we also had Thomarillion designed items made out of metal, hardfoam and wooden lasercut constuction kits produced by other companies.

The cooperation with Ziterdes grew during the years. At first only Thomas Reinheckel created new models for the company from Wangen but since the middle of 2006 me too. Thomas also designed ""Dunkelstadt - dark city"" by the way, a modular 3D-dungeon-system, gaining the title ""Model of the year"" by the journal ""ModelFan"" in 2008, the year of its release.

In the year 2010 we decided to change the production for most of the ceramic items to resin. We only kept the ceramic production for a few items of which it made sense to be ceramic and let all the other items produce extern in resin.

2010 was the year of the big break-over, because Thomas Reinheckel left and then Thomarillion became a ""one-man-show"".

Since then I try to increase my product range and to please the world of Tabletopers, Dungeongamers and Showcase-builders with my ""charming"" hotchpotch.:::7296:::1144:::0.0736107729076479:::0.2724401755651756:::1:::0:::2017|||"

"2066895977:::1670437593:::Jason Friend:::Based in Newcastle-Upon-Tyne in England’s North-East, Jason Friend is a professional travel and landscape photographer. For Jason, photography is more than a job; it is an opportunity to inspire. For over a decade, Jason Friend has devoted his life to combining his passion for photography with discovering the endless majesty of the natural world. From the rugged terrain of the Australian outback to the mountain summits of Switzerland, Jason has travelled the globe on a quest to immortalise nature’s most breathtaking moments. National Geographic, British Airways, Microsoft Corporation, Australian Geographic, Hasselblad and Rough Guides represent some of the many high-profile clients Jason has inspired and worked with along his journey.

Jason’s professional landscape photography is a dedication to our spiritual connections with the world around us. His photographs aim to convey the emotional experience of the landscape by extending beyond ‘pretty post-card’ visual appeal to engage and stimulate all the senses. Whether allowing us to taste the crisp, salty sea air from a surrounding beach, or feel the warm glow of sunrise peek out behind a rolling country hill, Jason’s landscape photography offers an enchanting escape route from the stress and distractions of our everyday lives, to an idyllic natural environment teeming with beauty and wonder. Jason’s venture into the world of nature and travel photography began with an image by landscape photography legend, Ansel Adams. Jason was captivated by the striking panoramas captured by many of Adams’ famous black and white images of the American West. Despite his early fascination with Adams’ work however, it was a trip to New Zealand in 1999 which inspired Jason to predominantly shoot in colour early on in his career. Immersed in the breath-taking landscapes of New Zealand, Jason learnt the powerful impact that temperamental light and weather conditions have upon the vulnerable environment below, and took this knowledge with him throughout his world travels and eventual foray into black and white photography.

For Jason, light is the master of his craft. His landscape photography is borne out of a deep respect towards mother nature’s ability to reveal the magnificence of her subjects in both illumination, and in darkness. Jason’s engaging images reflect a profound understanding of how light and shadow reign over nature, causing the landscape to transform with emotion. Motivated by the desire to bring the viewer closer to nature and convey this deeper insight, Jason skilfully captures his subjects in that crucial moment when form and texture is powerfully revealed through perfect light. Jason’s masterful approach to both colour and black and white landscape photography reveals nature’s most intimate moments to us, demonstrating his talent behind the lens, and his passion for the subjects within them.

“Time cannot be revisited; it changes everything in a split second. Whilst these moments can be spectacular, they can also herald more subtle changes. But one thing is for certain - this scene will never appear again. Fourteen years ago I left the UK on a quest to capture these fleeting moments. My role as a photographer is to convey these emotions, not by capturing an image but by sharing a vision….every trip spent behind the camera is special.”

Jason is available for photography workshops throughout Cumbria, Northumberland and Tyneside, and for commercial photography commissions throughout the UK. His stock photography images can be licensed via this site, and also his international agents which include Getty, Masterfile and Corbis.:::3648:::589:::0.15600272915490307:::0.4042361503231068:::11:::0:::2013|||"

At the age of seventeen, Hill wrote, produced, and promoted the LP in collaboration with a network of other young artists. Track one of the album “The Disconnect” won Hill the American Young Composers Award in 2015. The raw and ethereal record was celebrated as a step forward for the Minneapolis electronic scene, although this was just the beginning for Hill Cairns. After a three year hiatus from recording and performing, Hill has returned to the stage by the name CΔIRNS. Their time away from the scene was spent nurturing the spark that would grow into a new artistic identity and a new full length album (3.29.19). The new project is mature and well-rounded, incorporating aspects of R&B, indie electronic, POP, and jazz. CΔIRNS preserves the cerebral quality of their earlier work, now infused with a more sensual and intimate disposition. Though details regarding the release remain vague, Minneapolis will being keeping its ears to the ground as CΔIRNS continues to make moves in the world of contemporary music.:::1118:::186:::0.07375356125356124:::0.34332621082621084:::1:::0:::2019|||"

"1280484354:::1536906121:::World of Twilight:::Mike has been playing games since he first discovered Heroquest and Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay at school. It didn't take him long to start coming up with variant rules and converting figures.

While at university Mike started sketching out some rough ideas for funny little critters with hooves and the big nasty predators that hunt them down. The idea slowly expanded and evolved into Twilight. The first Twilight sculpts were somewhat crude and handcast, but over the years he has refined his sculpting and the rules for the game into something he says he is finally happy with! Almost 20 years on he's still playing with the same world and has a range of well over 100 miniatures and several books published.

Mike is responsible for the concept, artwork, rules, sculpts and generally has final say on everything (it's all his fault...)! Since its inception World of Twilight has also attracted a hugely supportive and creative community who have contributed stories, scenery, painting, playtesting and general discussion on the minutiae of the lives of the Fubarnii and the other creatures of Anyaral.:::1109:::184:::0.0066550925925925875:::0.4786747685185185:::5:::76:::2012|||"

"934288711:::176050905:::Stories in Structures:::OUR DESIGN MISSION

Stories in Structures is a Danish based architecture and design studio. Our mission is to create stories in structures through a design where sustainability and beauty meets. We design and produce all our products at our studio and work place situated in the heart of Copenhagen.

For us, it is important to be a part of the whole proces, from the design stage to the final product. In this way we can ensure sustainable workflow, high quality craftmanship, and there are no co2 cost in shipping back and forth.

Keeping the production in our own hands, instead of industrialising it by sending it to a country, where all production cost are much lower, fits to our philosophy of slow meaningfull design. We believe design should be slower – meaning not industrialised and more hands-on. This will mean that less is made, but it will have higher intrinsic value. We believe this approach will create better quality, less waste and it promotes greater cultural diversity and resilience.

The environmental issues the world is facing is real. It’s important that everyone does what they can to reduce waste and think wisely about their purchases. These elements are key to our process, - we create our products to last and hope they will be passed down generations to come. We believe that good design should last for a lifetime.:::1355:::230:::0.13962250712250712:::0.3440954415954416:::4:::0:::2018|||"

While directors and writers are a dime a dozen these days I am what they call a “diamond in the rough.” My work ethic, tenacity, ambition, and exceptional potential is what sets me apart from my contemporaries. I am exceptionally skilled with taking the least and making the most of it which makes me a financial asset to any production I work on because I believe that every penny spent needs to be worth its weight in gold. Because of my unique abilities to film more and spend less my films cost half to a quarter than what others would spend to achieve the same results. My capacity to turn out highly regarded grindhouse style westerns for fractions of a budget has earned me the nickname “The Sergio Leone of Montana” by my Hollywood mentors.

I have been doing filmmaking for the last 13 years. My strengths are in directing, editing, sound design, cinematography, and script writing. My impeccable storytelling capabilities both through writing and creative direction has been showcased in various projects from personal to commercial work I have done and will continue as such given my flair for also going above and beyond what is expected of me. Since 2006 I have primarily worked in the indie film sector and have written, directed, and produced over 30 digital audio/video projects with both personal and commercial titles under my belt and I am always looking for the next ambitious challenge to tackle

"1378390247:::1361461893:::Transglobal Underground:::There are few acts in the UK with as strong an influence, as complex a legacy, and as mysteriously legendary; even trying to describe what Transglobal Underground is and what it was has defeated the most eloquent of journalists.
So what is Transglobal Underground? Well, over 25 years it’s been a DJ/musical collective, a working band, a soundsystem,,a pop group, a club night, ahit production team, abrass band, a duo..or was it an octet? and several things no one involved would admit to if they could even remember them.

The music? Starting out in the 90s as a heady blend of dub, funk and bhangra, TGU have taken in a huge mixture of influences and style from around the world, a world they have always seen from the viewpoint of their London base. By the time the word multiculturalism was being bandied about as a buzz word TGU had long moved on , sticking to only two rules; it’s got to be funky and if you hear the warning sound of a barrier ahead, smash it down with bass.

Still a big festival favourit, no one at the start would have predicted that after all these years Transglobal Underground would still have the energy to continue a touring schedule that would finish most groups off. Transglobal Underground developed a life of its own, goes where it will for it’s own reasons. Everyone else simply follows.:::1329:::241:::0.08455555555555556:::0.3154920634920635:::1:::1:::2017|||"

I grew up in Russia, immigrated to Israel in 1990 and later moved to Europe, where I became a part of the European jazz scene, finally came to the United States, earning Master’s Degree in Composition and moved to Brooklyn, NY in 2008.

As a leader I released my American debut album ""Feathery"" in 2014 (Thirteenth Note Records). The album was top-rated in Downbeat Magazine, Pop Culture Classics, Jazz Inside Magazine, New York City Jazz Record, France Musique, Canadian Audiophile, Music Charts Magazine – and was voted the best debut release of 2014 by Dan Morgenstern, as well as one of the top 50 Jazz Albums 2014 (JazzLinks, Austria-Germany).

With eyes on the media industry, Kirk often collaborates in film, indie games, and various other projects he is enthusiastic about. A California native, Kirk attended the University of California Davis and graduated with honors in 2017 earning a B.A in Music. While there, he studied with Guggenheim fellows Kurt Rohde and Laurie San Martin. He is currently pursuing a master's degree from the Conservatory of Music at the State University of New York Purchase, studying with Laura Kaminsky.:::935:::154:::0.07908549783549786:::0.22443181818181815:::1:::3:::2018|||"

I started about 5 years ago popping wheat. I was able to get in some local grocery stores and was doing OK, but I learned quickly that people were steering away from modern wheat and there are a lot of people who are allergic. So, I went down the bulk grain aisle and chose about 15 different grains that were gluten free. I couldn't sleep that night...thinking about this project; to see if any of these grains would pop. Well, not many did, I found that amaranth popped some, but when I got to the sorghum.... WOW - it popped hard and fast and totally littered the kitchen. I went to work on a gluten free product that we named ""Glorious Grains"" it had a mixture of popped and roasted grains. I really didn't figure out that sorghum would be my future until a gentleman walk up at an outdoor farmers market and tells me that he likes my Glorious Grains but that he really loves that larger white popped grain, I told him that was sorghum, he said he was going on a road trip and asked if I could just pop him some of that. Sure, I said, I popped him a bag, and he gave me a $10...and then the light bulb went off in my head. From that day forward it has been my main product. Now I have 9 flavors (including my 3 new introduced by my latest Kickstarter), a total of 26 SKUs (that means different products) I'm in about 200 stores and my online business is booming. My facility is near Battleground WA and although my strong hold is the Pacific Northwest, I’m quickly expanding to California Idaho and Utah. What does the future hold for Nature Nate’s LLC? 1.	A new company and brand name as to not conflict with Nature Nate’s Honey.
2.	Crowd funding to raise equity capital.
3.	Automated equipment to help bring the price down and keep up with demand.
4.	Getting a bigger facility
5.	More “Exceedingly Healthy and Astonishingly Delicious” foods to come!:::2053:::389:::0.12964939247547944:::0.326728517054604:::4:::12:::2013|||"

"1350153050:::588048157:::Ridgemont:::I spent my youth battling against compromise. I followed my passions with the unshakable tenacity of a heat seeking missile. I participated in only hardcore activities and I expected the things I spent my money on to furnish me with an uncompromising purity of design. All or nothing. Do or die. That was then. I’m not old, in fact, I’m still quite young compared to many land tortoises and mountain ranges, but I’ve seen the world and experienced a lifetime of, uh, experiences. Not that much has changed, really. I still follow my passions with the heat soaking tenacity of an electric blanket, but I increasingly find myself searching for compromise. Compromise, in fact, was the inspiration for Ridgemont. The fact is, I don’t often forge rivers, but I do cross the occasional puddle. I don’t climb mountains, but I regularly climb hills. I’ve never hiked the Appalachian trail, but I hike the trail by my house all the time. I hike lots of trails, and not once has a mountain suddenly sprung up in front of me. You see what I’m saying? I want some traction. I want some water resistance. I want some durability, but I don’t want to look like I’m about to summit Denali. I go places and have adventures and I need great quality gear that won’t let me down, but I’m not exploring mars. I’ll surely never explore mars, so i don’t need boots built to survive a Martian winter, and blend in with the Martian natives. I need to hike to the surf break, then go get a breakfast burrito. I need to walk my dog then go to the office. I want to go on vacation to far flung places, but I’ve got to navigate an airport before I can get there, which definitely doesn’t require more spikes than a football boot. I wanted great looking, well made, simply styled shoes and clothes. I couldn’t find it so I made it. I named it Ridgemont.:::1824:::365:::0.04011752136752137:::0.1756920963651733:::3:::0:::2017|||"

"969141023:::958279794:::ANIME Impulse:::ANIME Impulse™ (アニメ インパルス) is the exciting new lifestyle project fusing the worlds of anime and video games, with the goal of providing casual fans and otakus the opportunity to gather and indulge in fandom. To meet like-minded people and motivate creativity in the community. Starting with our annual flagship main event - The ANIME Impulse, since each iteration our brand has continued to grow in all facets of the convention experience. With a flourishing Vendor Hall and Artist Alley, ANIME Impulse boasts an ever growing list of guests--cosplayers, anime industry notables, influencers--each year. ANIME Impulse has collaborated with notable brands such as Viz Media (Doraemon), San-X (Rilakkuma), Ghost in the Shell, Pusheen, Pocky, and even more. Around late 2018, ANIME Impulse wanted to fill the con-season void that comes about autumn, and thus INSANIME was born to a lively, celebratory debut of 500+ party goers. Packed to the brim in its capacity, The Belasco Theater became the ultimate Halloween destination for anime fans. With music that never failed to draw attendees out to the dancefloor, a glorious video game setup that kept partiers entertained, and even a cotton candy machine--INSANIME became a night to remember.



The care and attention to detail showcased in the events is also reflected through our online media content, with impeccable production quality and daring to venture down paths of creativity untouched by others. No matter the project, ANIME Impulse goes all out. From its incredibly insightful and engaging voice actor series “Behind the Voice,” to the deliciously enthralling “Cooking in Cosplay,” content goes far and wide on ANIME Impulse’s media channels.



Capturing nothing short of epicness in its Cosplay Throwdown cosplay short and its K/DA “POP/STARS” CMV, to a Q&A with Persona 5 actors Erika Harlacher and Xander Mobus, ANIME Impulse has accumulated over 100k+ views on YouTube alone.



Each year we challenge ourselves to go beyond the status quo of what we can do, each day we seek to break the traditional mold of what a typical anime convention or anime channel should give the fans. Help us, take ANIME Impulse to the next level - For you!:::2212:::365:::0.05494227994227994:::0.3965367965367966:::1:::0:::2019|||"

"146239659:::49938277:::Allison Adams Tucker:::Born in San Diego, California, multi-lingual jazz vocalist Allison Adams Tucker began singing before she could speak. Allison was raised by classically trained musical parents, and began performing in front of audiences at age 5. She studied piano, flute, violin, dance and voice from elementary school and holds a BA in Linguistics / Music Vocal Performance and an AA in Italian. Allison's vocal palette has been colored by her experience in a variety of musical genres throughout her life, from a cappella Elizabethan madrigals to punk rock to country to commercial jingles. Since 2005 Tucker has found the most natural fit to be jazz. The genre's freedom of expression and intellectual tilt were both appealing, as was its openness to absorb styles and accents from throughout the vocalist's travels.

Growing up on the border with Mexico, Allison was exposed to intermingling cultures and her love for languages and world cultures also began at an early age. She has studied and sings in 6 languages besides her own, lived in Japan and Spain, and has traveled to over 15 countries. This ""wanderlust"" is present in the music she chooses today— with rhythms, melodies, and lyrics of Brazil, Italy, France, Latin America, Japan, and the US. For Allison, it's all about the human connection, and music is the universal language.

Allison's debut album ""Come With Me"" (Allegato Music 2008), co-produced by jazz guitarist Peter Sprague (Dianne Reeves, David Benoit, Chick Corea, Sergio Mendes) and arranged by Kamau Kenyatta (Gregory Porter, Hubert Laws, Earl Klugh, Patti Austin), received international acclaim, was nominated for Best Jazz Album 2009 by the San Diego Music Awards, and continues to receive airplay on radio stations in 18 countries.

Allison's sophomore album ""April in Paris"" (Allegato Music 2014) celebrating songs of springtime from around the world, was recorded in Paris on UNESCO's 1st Annual International Jazz Day at the end of a 9-concert tour through Italy & France with international musicians and arrangers from five countries. Arrangers include Kamau Kenyatta, Danny Green, Emmanuel Massarotti, and Jovino Santos Neto.

Given 4 stars by DownBeat Magazine, Allison's third album ""WANDERlust"" (Origin Records 2016) was recorded in New York City under the direction of award-winning producer Matt Pierson (Brad Mehldau, Milton Nascimento, Joshua Redman, Jane Monheit). WANDERlust features a stunning all-star ensemble that not only bridges west and east coasts but adds flavors from around the world. Allison and Los Angeles pianist Josh Nelson are joined by New York jazz heavy-hitters Chris Potter, Matt Moreno, Scott Colley and Antonio Sánchez, along with percussionist Rogério Boccato and guitarist Romero Lubambo (both from Brazil) and French guitarist Stéphane Wrembel. The songs on WANDERlust are musical postcards from distant points of interest, from Rome to Paris to Takeda, Japan--and even destinations that exist purely in the mind's eye.

Allison returned to New York City in January 2019 to revisit her pop-punk past and record her fourth album RETRO Trilogy. RETRO - a trilogy of jazz re-imaginings of 3 decades of music from the 1970s, 80s, 90s including an original song, will be rolled out in 3 separate EPs across streaming platforms, and available as one CD. Musicians include Kevin Hays piano/rhodes/melodica, Tony Scherr bass/guitars, Kenny Wollesen drums/vibes, Yotam Silberstein guitar, Peter Sprague guitar, and Bashiri Johnson percussion. Arrangements by Allison, Kevin Hays, Josh Nelson, Danny Green, Yotam Silberstein, and Peter Sprague.

As a session artist, Allison's voice can be heard on national commercials and on the video game ""The Saboteur"" soundtrack singing French jazz in the company of Nina Simone, Ella Fitzgerald, Madeleine Peyroux, & others. This has resulted in a cult following by the typically ""non-jazz listening"" gamer audience, causing her interpretation of ""La Vie En Rose"" to become one of the top downloads on iTunes, Pandora, and Spotify worldwide.

As an international artist, Allison has entertained audiences in Japan, Europe, Mexico, and the US, including performances in the Blue Note New York, Ronnie Scott's London, Herb Alpert's Vibrato Los Angeles, San Jose Jazz, The Jazz Kitchen Indianapolis, Idyllwild Jazz in the Pines Festival, Hawaii Public Radio, Takatsuki Jazz Street Festival Osaka, Body & Soul Tokyo, Le Baiser Sale' Paris, Music Inn Rome, Lucca Jazz Donna Festival Tuscany, among others.:::4502:::705:::0.11353490259740258:::0.2916193181818182:::2:::3:::2012|||"

"1184439200:::1551439851:::Charlie Roth:::Americana, Folk, Blues, Country, Celtic, Charlie Roth is a unique blend of all these genres. What Charlie is best at is telling a story with his rich baritone vocal, acoustic guitar, rack harmonica, and foot percussion. His fifth album ‘Broken Ground’ reached up to #6 on the Euro Americana charts and continues to get air play all over the world. He has recorded with the likes of Sam Bush, Michael Bland and other American legends. A consummate showman, an entertainer with countless gigs under his belt, Charlie has mastered the art of playing and singing from his heart, exuding the sheer joy of making great music which can be felt by everyone who is connected to that magical and medicinal spiritual grace.

A Letter from Charlie
If you are here searching to find out what I do, and you can figure that out, please fill me in. Because I have been playing music professionally for most of my life and I am still searching, and wondering what that might be. I started out playing in bands when I was in my early twenties, while holding down a day job as a beer truck driver. So the bar sold beer as I played and then I would replenish their supply. I realized early on that my job was to make people happy and have fun for at least a few hours. Fast forward to 37 years later I am still essentially doing that same job. I quit delivering beer in 1981 but I never quite quit selling it. I am still very happy to be in the fun business!

ENTERTAINER
I have learned and forgotten at least a couple thousand songs; I can still hold in my memory several hundred and perform them solo or with a band. I have always loved learning songs and consider that fun. I have also learned not to play songs that I have grown tired of, because to do a song justice you must first know it by heart and then, most importantly, have your heart in it. Perhaps by learning all those songs I have trained my brain to think lyrically. I started writing my own songs early on, and it is a mystery where they come from, you will be just plunking along and suddenly it just happens. I had been playing music for my living for 20 years before I made my first record. I now have made nine albums and I sell them wherever I can to help fund my traveling habit. In my set I usually mix songs I have written in with songs I love and wished I had written.

SONGWRITER
I have a family; Bev and I have been together since she was 18 and I was 23, we have been married now for 34 years. Dylan was born in 1984 and Jonah in 1991 and since then became grandparents! I

have written songs for both my grand kids Morgan and Carter, those songs have become mainstays when I play concerts and sometimes even in clubs. Bev has her own business training and boarding horses along with riding lessons. We own a farm of 74 acres, that includes a 40+horse stable with a full size heated riding arena, and both a cross-country and stadium jump field. We have a Bobcat, two tractors, a manure spreader, and an old farmhouse in Benton County Minnesota. Bev is hard working and good with the fact that I would never be happy or much good at anything else. I have written several songs for her, most of them are happy. I am one of the luckiest people I know. I also work very hard at my music and have managed to stay booked solidly for decades. I am also smart enough to understand that if something that weighs 1200 lbs wants to come between us it just will.

FAMILY MAN
In 2010 my 5th album, Broken Ground came out and was well received in Europe, and, it went up to #6 on the Euro Americana chart. It was a dream come true. I was invited over for a short tour that year and have since released two more albums and have returned there every year touring mostly in the UK and Ireland.

That same year I joined the Celtic music group Ring of Kerry. When I started learning how to play Celtic music I noticed the similarities right away to the American songs I had been playing, and have always loved, coming mostly from Texas songwriters. I love a good melody and storyline. Country, Rockabilly, Blues, Folk, Cajun, Rock and Roll, I love playing it all. All over the world!!!

WORLD TRAVELELING TROUBADOUR “Story telling of the highest order, Charlie Roth is a name to remember” Ralph McLean show BBC in Northern Ireland

“His singing style and his narrative art are a perfect blend of words and meaningful lyrics” Valsem, Rootstime Netherlands

“He has an honesty to his voice, a been-there, lived-it nous that lends his tales credibility and raises his music up a notch or three” Americana UK on Charlie Roth http://www.americana-uk.com/reviews-cd-live/latest-cd-reviews/item/charlie-roth

A prolific songwriter in his own write, Charlie has also been a great interpreter of other writer’s work putting his unique stamp on everything he sings and plays. Highly influenced as a young man with great wordsmiths and the storytellers of the day, you can hear in his original works shades of fellow Minnesotan Bob Dylan, John Prine, Townes Van Zant, Leon Redbone, David Bromberg, Jesse Winchester, Greg Brown, Jerry Jeff Walker, and Waylon Jennings to name a few. Today Charlie has found his own voice and continues to grow as an artist finding inspiration, influencing, and being influenced by his contemporaries.

"1687313036:::1189308695:::MSSB:::Magnolia Street String Band started in 2013 as an informal project among some friends, meeting and picking in Highland Park, NJ. Originally there was a cellist. And no banjo. In the summer of 2013, they stumbled into a booking for a local festival gig opening for Tony Trischka. To get ready for the performance, the band invited Paul Prestopino (illustrious backing player for Peter, Paul and Mary, The Chad Mitchell Trio and many others) to join their ranks. A couple months later, they added veteran NYC musician and master of all things stringed, Bobby Baxmeyer. The new members, along with the original core of Matthew Backes and Sheila Shukla, played their first gig in March 2014. Not long after, renowned Philly-area bassist, Ron Greenstein (Lewis Brothers, Skookil Express, Travis Wetzel Trio) joined the group, bringing rock solid, driving rhythm. Since 2014 the band has played a steady stream of shows to ever larger and more appreciative audiences. They have played festival stages, state fairs, hootenannies, honky tonks, and more refined events as well. Their music is grounded in traditional bluegrass with elements of cosmic Americana, country, and old-time as well as original compositions mixed in. The band’s sound features powerful three-part harmonies and compelling instrumentals. Overall, their take on bluegrass feels old but relevant, traditional but personal, and well crafted but soulful and direct.:::1427:::226:::0.18202214452214452:::0.3682789432789433:::1:::0:::2019|||"

"405217631:::1963115947:::Liam Manjon:::I have been rapping since the early nineties, but I only took it seriously the last year. I started rapping as way to raise money to bail people out of jail who are in there simply because they don't have enough money to pay their bails. I then moved on to take it seriously once I learned how effective the medium is for relaying messages and agitating the masses. I have been a communist and anarchist organizer for close to a dozen years now and hip hop is the perfect way to get ideas out there, which is an important part of organizing.

We were homeless multiple times when I was younger, we used to stay in our car and also sometimes in camp sites for weeks. A lot of times we didn't have enough to eat and were forced to steal to eat. I grew up on the streets on Pittsburgh and Madison, although Madison mostly. Mom was a single mom with five kids, no support from any of the dads came in ever. My mom taught me about the Industrial Workers of the World anti racism and workers' power from as early as I could remember. I went to my first protest when I was four weeks old, she was a single mom and the Pennsylvania government was trying to cut off welfare to folks, even folks with four week old kids.

In Pittsburgh my brother was in the paper for being the first white kid to attend the Northview heights middle school. Folks in Northview heights used to throw bricks at the cops, they didn't let them in to the neighborhood, and the cops and city government treated the people of Northview heights like they were in an open air prison, not unlike Palestine. They made it so there is only two ways in or out of the neighborhood so they could control the community, then they closed down one of the entrances. I remember there were no grocery stores around for miles so we bought our raw meat out of a truck that drove through the neighborhood.

In Madison, I also lived on the streets as a teenager. I used to spare change for money to eat, eat out of dumpsters and stay in the basements and stairwells of various apartment complexes and state buildings around the downtown area. I have seen everything go down in Madison. I have seen things change in Madison too.:::2181:::412:::0.045928017455795216:::0.3585040473929363:::1:::0:::2019|||"

The Last Revel utilizes their multi-instrumental abilities to bring the full spectrum of modern Americana to life with lush arrangements of three-part vocal harmonies, acoustic and electric guitars, upright bass, fiddle, and 5-string banjo to consistently support impassioned performances of their honest and heartfelt songwriting. With their third full length album, Hazard & Fate, The Last Revel further demonstrates their ability to create rich and delicately textured recorded material with a modern “tip of the hat” to the storied history of American folk music.:::1069:::169:::0.06304166666666666:::0.43711111111111106:::3:::0:::2013|||"

Il a réalisé un premier court métrage auto-produit en 2012, sélectionné au Festival Off-courts de Trouville. Après un premier changement de carrière qui l’a vu devenir blogueur voyage professionnel, Christopher est aujourd’hui enseignant, notamment en Cinéma. Parallèlement à cette activité, il a repris l’écriture et la réalisation de courts métrages en 2018.


S’il désire autant réaliser des films, c’est pour communiquer, partager et interroger sur l’intime, ce qui se passe à l’intérieur de nos têtes, notre psychologie, notre rationalité parfois mise à mal par des émotions intenses et contradictoires. Dans son premier film, Paris in Love, déjà, il dressait un paradoxe entre ce que le personnage principal exprimait à l’oral et son véritable ressenti par rapport aux évènements. Avec Entrevue, tourné fin 2018, il poursuit cette réflexion avec le portrait d’une actrice qui « joue le rôle » et cherche à cacher ses émotions pour offrir le visage attendu par son entourage.:::1165:::203:::0.0625:::0.075:::1:::5:::2019|||"

Most important – they’ll get you drinking a good cuppa tea without any waiting. Our Tea Glasses, Teapots, Thermo Cups and Bottles put complex tea brewing strategies in your hands – without any of the research or practice you would need to do otherwise.

Of course, there’s no single “best” theine system out there. We have drawn on ample experience in order to develop our entire amapodo product range, though, and we are confident our tea products are just what you need to move past all the complexities of tea and just start drinking.:::1606:::285:::0.1679949874686717:::0.4294099832915622:::1:::2:::2019|||"

"1715525500:::1987374586:::Magnetic Eye Records:::Magnetic Eye Records is a New York-based record label founded in 2011 by Greatdayforup and Ironweed guitarist Mike Vitali.

The company grew out of a lifelong love of musicianship, artistry and study of the record business, and was driven by the belief that guiding musicians to survive and thrive should be a key responsibility of any record label.

Mike grew up with a family record collection spanning back to the 1920s, and purchased his first two LP records (Metallica's Ride the Lightning and Pink Floyd's Wish You Were Here) as a teenager at the Sunrise Mall in Massapequa. As a working musician, Mike experienced the satisfaction of having labels release his music, as well as the thrill of seeing it presented in stunning vinyl form, and conceived Magnetic Eye to extend that opportunity to other artists. He also wanted to use his industry knowledge to provide artists with an understanding of how to map out successful careers.

Magnetic Eye focuses heavily on deluxe vinyl releases, and boasts an ever-developing roster that includes heavy rock and hardcore artists Sunflo'er, Elephant Tree, Brond, I Am Become Death, The Nopes, Low Flying Hawks, Summoner and Watchtower. The company’s ongoing mission is to work with emerging artists and support their amazing music while revamping perceptions of what record labels are and can be.:::1350:::223:::0.31352813852813854:::0.6534271284271285:::18:::19:::2012|||"

Known for the performances at the National Theatre in Germany as well as in the ART-Vic’s The Seagull, The Idiot, King Lear and Hamlet in London. To be a complete opposite to who I am in real life is what motivates me, when taking up a new role. Due to my historical background, beyond English, I speak Russian and German on the native level. A trilingual actor, represented by Mrs Jordan Associates.

Born in Ukraine and grew up in Germany. After having performed one of the lead roles in the production ""Water always finds its Way"" at the National Theatre in Germany and after the desire to make a full time job out of my hobby, I moved to London in order to bring my acting career to a higher level. Apart from acting, I am also equipped with various other artistic skills like dancing (Break Dance and Hip Hop), martial arts (Taekwondo), singing (Tenor) and more, which often helped me to master the role.:::1090:::201:::-0.0830948372615039:::0.3677188552188553:::2:::0:::2018|||"

"136768382:::579622157:::Noah Segobia (Baker):::For nearly 2 decades of my life I’ve worked in the food industry. Everything from dishing washing, to waiter, to professional chef and managing. Food and cooking for others is undoubtedly my life’s passion. That’s why I chose to leave it all behind to set out on my own venture. Create my own menus, and introduce the word to bold new fusion cuisines, simple ingredients and explosive flavors.

However shortly after that journey began several years ago, I was diagnosed with a debilitating form of chronic kidney disease. There were no solutions from the doctors or nephrologists. It was just something I had with to live with I was told, and only a matter of time until I needed dialysis and ultimately my kidneys failed. I couldn’t sit and do nothing so I took matters into my own hands. All my research regarding beating and reversing the disease initially led me to a whole food plant based diet. So within the last few years I made the full dietary commitment to go vegan....and it saved my life. From total lethargy to total vitality within a few weeks. It has been a complete awakening. I have never turned back and these days Veganism is no longer just about me and health, but for the animals who have no voice, for the earth, and for all my loved ones. This has been the best decision of my life without a doubt- I’ve never felt more connected the world around my and to my food.:::1392:::263:::0.15732323232323234:::0.39945406445406456:::1:::0:::2019|||"

Their debut album Loan was formed through humble means – recorded in a dingy, sweaty Italian basement by Scottish frontman/songwriter Tom Stearn and then sent half way across the world to A Pocket Full Of Stones studio in Australia to be mixed. Embarking on the launch of their new sci-fi inspired studio album Arrows, the band’s somewhat dispersed members (Pietro Martinelli, bass – Genoa // Marco Giongrandi, guitar – Brussels // Riccardo Chiaberta, drums – London) combine their unique experience in their respective music scenes to sculpt new worlds, new images, new stories.

Their soon to be released second album Arrows is inspired by the sci-fi world of the author Isaac Asimov – Sumptuous Fleet Foxes-esque sunsets, roaring Grizzly Bear reverbs and cyclic classical guitar lines, with an undercurrent of minimal electronic drums and synth reminiscent of Radiohead.:::1083:::182:::0.017788600288600288:::0.3364646464646465:::1:::0:::2019|||"

"1397221176:::275002378:::Rachel Stern:::Rachel Stern (b. 1989, NYC) is a photographer whose work considers the intersection of beauty and power. Stern turns to the tableaux and the proscenium in order to create a strong dialogue between the histories and uses of kitsch and leftist aesthetics. Using materials culled from suburban strip malls she creates images which ask art and visual culture to enter into an accessible discourse and which, in the spirit of ‘bread and roses’, demands immediate access to beauty. Her work images a world that might be, built out of the world that is. It is a kitsch paradise, a queer-washed history, and an attempt at hope. She received her BFA in Photography and the History of Art and Visual Culture in 2011 from the Rhode Island School of Design, attended Skowhegan in 2014, and graduated from Columbia University in 2016 with an MFA in Visual Arts.

I grew up in an artistic family and spent most of my childhood in Elmira, New York. After living for years in Florida, I settled in Hendersonville, North Carolina and now make the mountains my home.

After picking up my first digital SLR camera in 2006, I discovered that the beauty of Western North Carolina helped train my eye, and hone my photographic skills. In 2009, I stumbled on an abandoned airplane graveyard in St. Augustine, Florida. Shooting the derelict planes, I discovered a passion for abandonment photography. Since then I have focused on developing a personal style of photography that I call “The Art of Abandonment”.

I travel the country seeking to photograph and document our nations modern ruins. By photographing these abandoned and endangered places, I help to preserve the history and tell the stories of these locations before they are gone. I have received national and international recognition. Most notably, Hollywood movie director Ron Howard selected one of my images to inspire a short film, When You Find Me. Howard chose “The Final View” out of almost 100,000 entries to craft a setting for the story. I have also worked with camera manufacturer Sigma, creating images for several of their advertising campaigns published in over 25 international magazines.:::1376:::228:::0.08275058275058275:::0.2390831390831391:::2:::28:::2011|||"

It became obvious to me that without an alternative to single use plastics, we would actually destroy the Ocean, which supports all life on this planet (no Ocean, no life), and that's when I shifted from the film industry (where I found platinum silicone btw), to being a full time social impact entrepreneur/activist.:::742:::125:::0.11650793650793652:::0.31297619047619046:::3:::7:::2013|||"

In 1996 I was nominated for Golf Digest's Environmental Leaders in Golf award. I've been involved in a few different business ventures since then and because of these initiatives, I have had the privilege to live and work in both the US (San Francisco) and Canada (Vancouver).

Soon after our first child was born, my wife, new baby and I moved onto a sailboat in downtown Vancouver. I ended up helping a good friend setup a company in San Francisco so we sailed south and continued living aboard while in California. On the opposite end of the spectrum, we now live in a log home in the mountains just outside of Vancouver with our two incredible kids and way too many animals. I grew up spending most of my time outdoors. We're now surrounded by nature on our property, and seeing my kids venture out into it, has rekindled my appreciation for the great outdoors and helped make VSSL a reality.

"1620075428:::1658426279:::Vanishing Shores:::As a lifelong seeker of truth, Kevin Bianchi has spent his entire musical career embracing and wrestling with the mystery of life and love in song. This has been exemplified by his time as the lead singer and songwriter for the indie rock band, the Chestertons. Having achieved regional success with the single 'Coast Road' and dynamic performances opening for artists such as James McCartney, he now begins a new journey with the formation of Vanishing Shores. ""The need to reach out and connect with those around us has never been greater,"" states Bianchi. It is this realization that inspires and informs each song by Vanishing Shores. From the opening of 'In Between' to the closing notes of 'Blurred' on their self-titled EP, the listener is invited to become a part of the story, not as a stranger but as a fellow traveler who is loved and accepted. The answers may not be found. Everything known may collapse at any moment, but 'even still, I won't let you go.' This promise, in all of its emotional complexity, is the true vision of Vanishing Shores. Influenced by diverse artists such as Neil Finn and Elvis Costello, Vanishing Shores is not 'business as usual' but a band that pursues beauty wherever it may lead. Just like their musical inspirations, Vanishing Shores strive to deliver passionate, well-crafted rock and roll in each and every performance. As the band continues to develop, each song points to a future that is filled with limitless potential, founded on the power of music and the community it creates.:::1530:::262:::0.12427669552669553:::0.33975829725829726:::1:::0:::2019|||"

"293767764:::854707545:::The Game Boy Geek - Dan King:::The name “Game Boy Geek” is the merging of two aspects from Dan’s life: When Dan was a youngster, he would walk around the house with a stack of games in his hands--sometimes the stack was higher than eye level. He would ask every person he came across, “Wanna play a game?” He was dubbed the “Game Boy” and it has stuck with him all his life, since his love for games has never ended. This pre-dates the Nintendo Gameboy's release in 1989, so his Dad now calls him ""The Original Game Boy"". Fast forward. Dan graduated from Northeastern University with a degree in electrical engineering. Once in the workforce, he obtained Six Sigma Green Belt and Black Belt certifications. Essentially Six Sigma uses statistical methods to streamline and/or solve any technical- or business-related problems or processes without approaching defects (99.99966% of the time). Combining his love for games with his engineering and Six Sigma background, Dan uses these unique skills when reviewing and creating his own strategies for games. This approach helps game lovers of all ages enjoy their games even more, by understanding the game at a much deeper level, while learning how to apply mathematics, statistics, and logic to everyday life.:::1226:::215:::0.0375:::0.4324074074074074:::4:::17:::2013|||"

"969453887:::675079996:::Matthew Buchholz:::I'm Matthew Buchholz and I own and run Alternate Histories. I grew up in Tucson, AZ, graduated from NYU, lived in Brooklyn for years and moved to Pittsburgh in 2008. I now combine my love of history and bad sci-fi movies into my art.

My work began with a show at Wildcard in 2010, a great store in Pittsburgh where I had the inspiration to photoshop a gigantic monster into an old engraving of the city. Since then I've expanded with different cities, holiday & greeting cards, original works and more, all taking historic images and adding in something from a pop culture sci-fi background. My first book, ""Alternate Histories of the World,"" was released by Perigee in October 2013. I've run several successful Kickstarter projects and love the platform.

I design all of my own pieces and ship everything myself. I love being an artist full-time, and being able to support myself with my crazy ideas.

Each piece starts with the original image. I do a lot of online and flea market research to find interesting pieces, then I look for some monster, robot, alien or other creature that fits the style of the piece. I do all this in playing with my dog Otis and listening to sixties soul music.:::1201:::214:::0.21336805555555557:::0.47951388888888885:::8:::42:::2014|||"

Cook Eat Home comenzó su creación en Febrero de 2012, en Abril de 2015 se procedió a la constitución de la sociedad durante 2015,2016 y 2017 se han realizado diversas rondas de inversión con capital de inversores privados. Esta acción nos aportó pulmón financiero para terminar las herramientas. Cook Eat Home fue concebida para dotar al Chef de un gestor de platos, donde este puede publicar todos los platos que se le ocurran y con un solo click publicar ofertas personalizadas, sin necesidad de realizar un cambio de carta ahorrando los costes que esto supone. Como consecuencia de la creación de esta herramienta y haber conseguido más de 500 usuarios chefs, pudimos continuar con nuestra investigación y nos dimos cuenta que los chefs anhelaban la libertad de crear, deseaban salir de sus rutinas y necesitaban continuar aprendiendo para mejorar sus técnicas y platos. Aquí nace Cookexperiences, una iniciativa que permite a todos los chefs del mundo abrirse al mercado, crear su propia imagen de marca y compartir cocinas con otros chefs que le aporten conocimiento, técnicas y nuevas experiencias. Comprobamos a lo largo de todo 2017 y 2018 que nuestra iniciativa era viable y que cubria una necesidad muy importante en los tiempos que corren, cuando hay multitud de talento y no existe nadie que se lo reconozca. Estrellas Michelin por desgracia hay pocas, en cambio Estrellas como tal existen miles repartidas por todo el mundo y nosotros los queremos ayudar a dar voz a su cocina y posicionarlos donde merecen.:::1717:::283:::0.0:::0.0:::1:::0:::2019|||"

I then took the management experience and the kitchen experience and took a management position in an Exeter restaurant, which was very hands on. then the opportunity I had always wanted came along, a full time position in Games Workshop Exeter, when I spent 5 years, including nearly a year managing the torquay store while they found a permanent replacement. Then after the 5 years family became a priory, I went part time to help raise my children, but after a few years I wanted to get back into the working world, but decided to work for myself, I opened a shop called Khaos Games, a hugely successful store in exeter, with events with over 120 people attending, for games like MTG, Yugioh, all the while keeping the Warhammer and 40k games going.
Sadly after a 10 year run I became very ill, I was hospitalised, and was forced to closed, it wounds have been fair to my wife to make her run the shop while having to bring up the children on her own.
so two years after that horrible day I finally began to leave the house, 2 years on and I'm fighting fit and couldn't wait to reopen the shop, which I did successfully 7 months ago! now its time to expand that shop and blend all my experience together!:::1407:::259:::0.07455357142857143:::0.41250000000000003:::1:::2:::2013|||"

"1368029591:::1529710615:::Johnny Holle:::RACECARCoolers is an idea I am passionate about. Idea originated in 2001. I was a farmer most of my life raising corn, wheat, soybeans, hogs and cattle. I had a seed business with 75 dealers selling my seed that I processed on my farm. As a farmer I came up with new and labor saving ideas. I had an interest in racing cars and this idea popped in my head one day. Designed and filed for patent in 2010, Patent granted 9-13-2011. Prototype made in 2012. Costs are crazy. Prototype bids ranged from $15,000 to $100,000. Most bids were around $25,000. I went with the cheap bid. It looks great, but is fragile. I have been to Charlotte contacting race teams for licensing. I believe 3 major teams will grant licensing when we (you & my team) raise the start up money. Other teams will certainly want to license RACECARCoolers when you prove the demand to them. I interviewed 400 tailgating fans at Kansas Speedway. 100% excitedly said "" WOW that is so cool!! Where can I get one?"" I now have a team (a former VP of licensing of a major race team, social media marketing whizz, manufacturers, USPS to ship, and dozens more are a part of the team) put together to raise the startup funds via Kickstarter.:::1200:::218:::0.09415449134199136:::0.3284713203463203:::1:::0:::2013|||"

Ambas mujeres se enfrentan ante lamentable realidad llevando consigo el amor a esta actividad que fue, es y será el trabajo de toda su vida. Esto las motiva a no desistir y mantienen la esperanza de que el tejido de sombrero no desaparezca.

Esta, es una historia con un propósito: ser parte aguas en el rescate y preservación de una de las tradiciones más icónicas del Bajío guanajuatense, misma que le ha dado una identidad a San Francisco del Rincón y que bien merece ser reconocida como lo que es, un legado cultural y riqueza de nuestro Estado.

Both women face this sad reality carrying within themselves the love for this activity ,that is and will always be their lifes work.

"1799701328:::537780863:::Nadira Farid:::Nadira, often called fiery pocket rocket, is an Australian jazz vocalist who brings her diverse individual style of wit and sensitivity. She has always been singing since young age and gigging sporadically since her teens. In early 2014, following intermittent jazz jams here and there, she was reminded of TWO of her FIRST LOVES, SINGING and JAZZ...and BOOM! Ever since she has not stopped DREAMING BIG and punching above her weight always!

Her ensemble, Nadira and Friends, showcases a fresh, fun, modern and cheeky take on well-loved hot swing and cool ballad tunes from the Great American Songbook, some Latin jazz, and intricate tunes composed by the jazz greats, the like of Brubeck, Evans and Monk. Nadira and Friends has experienced well-received performances at all Tasmanian jazz festivals, such as Hot August Jazz, Clarence Jazz Fest, and Devonport Jazz Fest. She has also performed at Jazz By The Bay (JBTB) WA, Castlemaine Jazz Festival, VIC, MONA, Paris Cat Jazz Club, Doo-Bop Jazz Bar, Dizzy’s Jazz Club and Open Studio. Highlights included sold out gigs at Devonport Jazz Fest, JBTB and at Paris Cat Jazz Club.

Nadira grew up in a jazz/music loving family in Jakarta, Indonesia, before she moved to Melbourne in 1999 then moved to Hobart, Australia in 2010, where she is currently based.


From mid 2014 , she started her jazz singing adventure more seriously, and formed a jazz ensemble called Nadira and Friends at the end of 2014. Since then she has been busy gigging in Tasmania and Victoria, collaborated with various top-class Australian jazz musicians, attending private lessons and mentored by some of the best Australian jazz musicians, and is now performing regularly around Australia.:::1720:::281:::0.12858946608946611:::0.35857475857475857:::1:::1:::2019|||"

"435281829:::1778122855:::Mark Gibson:::Mark Gibson is a Tulsa, OK based singer/songwriter with an affinity for soul music, blues, and rock n roll. In the early 2000's, he played open mics and songwriter nights in the Oklahoma City area, where he attended college. After graduation, he moved to Austin, TX. With drummer, David Kittridge ,and bassist, Ryan Magnani, they formed the band Meridianwest. After a few years of successful live shows, two studio EPs, and a full length live album, Gibson left the band to pursue a solo career. In 2010 he released an untitled EP of 5 tracks, including ""Beautifully Deconstructed"" and ""Firework Shows."" In 2012 he released his first full length studio album, ""Beautifully Deconstructed."" Produced by Gibson and former band mate, Magnani, the album was a mixture of his U2 inspired Meridianwest days, and a new soulful direction. After the release, it became clear to Gibson that he wanted to be true to his blusey and soulful nature. He began to write in the genres of blues, soul, gospel, Motown, and rock n roll, and hasn't looked backed since. In 2016, he released his second studio album, ""Blue Eyed Soul,"" to much fan praise. He finally had an album that reflected his soulful nature, and live shows. After the release, he started to play a lot of full band shows around the Tulsa area to promote ""Blue Eyed Soul."" The fantastic players and the energy of the shows inspired Gibson to make the decision to release a live album next. He recorded shows at Soul City in Tulsa throughout 2017, which became his compilation live album, ""Live From Soul City"" (2018). From 2016 to 2019, Gibson has been writing... a lot. All his traveling has lead to over 1,000 voice memos, with a fair amount simply being a vocal and steering wheel percussion recorded while driving on the highway. The music has his signature soulful delivery, yet contains something new as well. It's more vulnerable, honest, and connected.:::1908:::330:::0.19385964912280704:::0.3980614414824941:::5:::5:::2010|||"

Bryan has also been a security guard, police officer, and armored car vault manager. And he was a youth pastor. Eventually, he decided he'd take the ""easy path"" and become a writer. He was an idiot. Writing is not easy, but it turned out, he was pretty good at it. People seemed to like his stories, so he kept telling them. Bryan is a published author (fiction and non-fiction), game designer, graphic artist, web designer, consultant, trainer, ministry leader, and multiple-business owner. He is also happily married to his wife of over 20 years, Christina, and father to six or seven kids, depending on the day. He even sleeps occasionally.

I created Leggings With Attitude to address these issues and also to inspire and empower women. Through this brand I want to raise awareness for needy and disadvantaged women and share a percent of profits with charities focused on giving a leg up to these women to help their own lives and the lives of their families. After graduating from college, I worked for many years in the music industry in marketing and product development. I eventually started my own public relations and artist management company. Through my experiences I learned a great deal about marketing, branding and promotion. A few years ago I transitioned from the music business to online marketing and with my husband founded such brands as Anavita Skin Care, Heart Healthy Solution, Handy Auto Glass and Ruby Peach.

"1140543784:::582683296:::Allison Orr:::From sanitation workers to firefighters, Venetian gondoliers to professional baseball players, power linemen to forestry technicians, Allison Orr creates award-winning choreography with all kinds of performers. Challenging audiences to expand notions of dance and performer, Allison finds the raw material for her work in the stories and experiences of ordinary people, spending months researching and immersing herself in the community she is engaging. Uncovering that which is essential to the life of a community but often goes unnoticed is central in Allison’s work, as she seeks to give voice to people who may be marginalized or frequently overlooked.

Allison was named Best Choreographer of 2016 by The Austin Chronicle, Most Outstanding Choreographer of 2003, 2008 and 2013 by the Austin Critics Table, one of Tribeza Magazine’s Top 10 Austinites, and one of eight ""Extraordinary Texans"" by Texas Highways Magazine. Her large-scale work, The Trash Project, was named a #1 Arts Event by the Austin American-Statesman, #1 Dance Event by the Austin Chronicle, Most Outstanding Dance Concert by the Austin Critics Table, and is the subject of a feature-length documentary film entitled Trash Dance. Allison has been commissioned three times by the Fusebox Festival and was the single US choreographer selected by the Kyoto Arts Center as part of NPN’s Asian Exchange program in 2015. A guest artist for numerous dance programs including Williams College, Wake Forest University, the University of Maryland, and Texas A&M, Allison was a Melon Foundation Creative Campus Scholar at the Center for the Arts of Wesleyan University in 2014/15. Allison gives frequent lectures and talks, and was the keynote speaker at the 2015 Texas Commission on the Arts statewide conference. Her work has been funded by the City of Austin, the Texas Commission on the Arts, the National Endowment for the Arts, the Mid-America Arts Alliance, the MAP Fund, The New England Foundation for the Arts, numerous foundations, and the City of Venice, Italy. Last year, Allison was the 2015-16 Menakka and Essel Bailey Distinguished Visiting Scholar in the College of the Environment at Wesleyan University where she directed The Artist in the City—a hands on course in her community-based dance making practice. As teacher, Allison has taught a variety of students, including children, adults over 65, and people with disabilities. Before founding Forklift Danceworks, Allison taught and studied with MacArthur Award winner Liz Lerman and performed with Robert Moses and Janice Garrett in the San Francisco Bay Area. Allison is a native Texan and holds an MFA in Choreography and Performance from Mills College and a BA in Anthropology from Wake Forest University.:::2744:::435:::0.09224461435999899:::0.28246173698096777:::5:::26:::2010|||"

I realized then that this was my calling, and whilst the story writing came easily to me I struggled initially with the illustrations having never tried my hand at the before. Many late nights, screwed up pieces of expensive paper and failed attempts later I feel that I have finally made it to the standard I strived for it was a case if sonar but so far (pun intended) to begin with.

My name is Kole Trent, and I want You to know Me… I am a young artist born in 1996, who grew up primarily, and still resides in Florida. Growing up in Cocoa Beach, my first love quickly became surfing. At age 10 I picked up my first paint brush and set my heart and eyes upon a blank canvas. With the waves still under my board, and a paintbrush in hand, I have merged these two loves into the life I am currently living and sharing with you through every piece of art I create. The pieces I create come from so deep within me that define them as the very essence of Who I am. I have been blessed with many gifts in Life, but the gift I cherish most is the gift I’ve termed “True sight”. I see the true beauty of this world through vibrant colors, the magnificence of nature, through Love and Peace that can and does exist if we embrace it, through kindness and serenity, through lightness of heart and soul, through smiles passed amongst us. This kaleidoscope of Life is what I put into every wave I ride, and every brushstroke that touches my canvas. I would love nothing more than to continue to give back to those in need and continue bringing light to this dark world.

Living New Orleans, LA to be the residency director at Court 13 Arts, Madison, WI for the Windgate Residency at UW-Madison, and Penland School of Crafts to teach. Next year Evelyn will travel to San Francisco to be the Wornick Distinguished Professor in the fall and then head South to San Diego State University to be the Windgate resident artist in the Spring. This has meant she has not lived anywhere long enough to become part of the community. Always an active community member in the past, as a mentor in the public high school while a resident artist at Penland, teaching free upholstery classes to kids in New Orleans, and member of Vecinos in Mitchell County, this has paid a heavy toll.

Never in my life could I ever have imagined undertaking a creative project like this one, and another one I'm also dedicated to which is a story I intend to make into a movie entitled Mercy! Saints! Alive! Over the last few years I have suddenly moved from a calculated business person into a highly motivated creative person. I feel strongly that our politicians in both parties continually use and abuse the people that they represent. I have studied government waste for years, and now I have a burning desire to share what I have learned with other taxpaying Americans. I have also been an avid baseball card collector, so I do understand how limited printings work. This is why I have decided to do such a small first edition run for the benefit of my backers only.

"1286013947:::453288190:::Eddison Romeo:::Eddison Romeo was born in Trinidad and Tobago in the late 70's and grew up in the South Bronx with his mom and brother. He currently resides in Newburgh New York, from the age of 5 years old, his brother and him would walk around The Metropolitan Museum Of Art, where his mom worked until she ﬁnished her shift. They spent many years at the museum walking around and just exploring all that the Met had to oﬀer. On Saturday’s they would attend Art and craft classes and then continued to roam freely around the museum all day. “It was like we grew up at The Met, we would go there all the time from an early age even up until college, it was our after school program as well.” He never realized attending all those art classes and his overall experience would have such an impact on his life until years later. He could remember this one speciﬁc painting by an artist named Paul Jackson Pollock who was an inﬂuential American painter, and the leading force behind the abstract expressionist movement in the art world. He really admired his creativity and his abstract, splatter and drip 'action approaches within his paintings. All he could do is just stare at Mr. Pollock work and analyze it every time he would go to The Met. As he got older, he became involved in Acting, Writing, Boxing and Directing but he never pursued painting until he one day he was inﬂuenced his brother. ""Shirt King Phade"" in 1998. He paid him $700 to paint a tiger on a canvas and was intrigued about how vibrant the colors looked. So he decided to paint over Phade’s paint by using special paint that only heightened the colors. The best part was that in the day it was phade’s version but at night it was his. When the black light was turned on the tiger came to life. This was what caused him to begin his journey as an Artist. Now he didn’t have to pay anyone, he could create whatever he wanted. In 2012 he created his ﬁrst piece and again in 2015 he did his second piece but the majority of his work was painted in 2016. His ﬁrst gallery was at The Breathe of Life in Newburgh Ny. He had his work there on display for the Majority of 2016 until he decided to dream bigger. He worked nonstop and painted over 40 paintings in 2016, now he was ready to show his work to the world. He opened his ﬁrst oﬃcial gallery exhibit at the Catalyst Gallery, 137 Beacon, NY. What a leap of faith it took, not to mention how costly it is to do so he said, “ I Never knew how expensive it is to have your own gallery until now and the work you have to put in. From choosing the location to how you hang and showcase your work, not to mention how important lighting is.” He even made smaller paintings and sold raﬄes so that 10 lucky winners would get a chance to win one of he creations. He raised close to $2000 and donated all of the proceeds to the Lupus Foundation. His show was from January 11th to Feb 6th 2017. After 2017 , his work has been displayed at the Historical Howland Center for various shows in Beacon, NY. He also had the opportunity to showcase his work “Jumbo Love” for the amazing exhibit/Show “The Art Of Balance back in June and July 2018. Which was also at the Howland Center. Through it all he continues to inspire, create and imagine as he continues to Dream big and make all his dreams a reality. Artist Statement


Eddison's work portrays the ideology that color opens up one’s third eye, which is one’s soul. He has completed thirty-seven paintings in a year and a half, where by using various mediums and colors, his work comes to life. By using, explosive, robust and invigorating colors you will be able to see his work both in the day, night and with the black light. His vision is to have such an eﬀect on the human eye/soul that it takes the viewer to a whole new level of imagination and creativity. As Eddison continues to explore and tap into his vivid imagination, who knows what he will create next. As an Artist, he strives to always push his imagination and bring to life something amazing for the world to see, color-by-color, stroke-by-stroke, splat-by-splat and drip-by-drip. To him art just happens and he can't explain it. In the words of Paul Jackson Pollock “ The painting has a life of its own. I try to let it come through.:::4247:::811:::0.11245775423407:::0.3130344801397433:::1:::0:::2015|||"

What is distinctive in my works is much color, different materials and shapes. I get my inspiration from everything, from eras, how it was before, how the future can look, etc. I am inspired a lot by other artists and sometimes try to combine different styles into something completely new. I began to illustrate as a magazine magazine as a 14 year old and as a 16 year old I illustrated garments for a small store in Borlänge that produced their own collections. The same year, I was selected among hundreds of students in Borlänge high school to get to camp for creatively talented students. After that I have attended various art courses within the national school.
I am self-taught and have developed my artistry throughout my life. I was also fascinated by the digital art and trained me as a Graphic designer. I took a break in connection with my vision deteriorating greatly due to eye diseases and did not dare to create anymore because I doubted my ability to see. The lack of creation and the creative process became too great so one day I started again and Today I create more than ever -. In addition to paintings and illustrations, I also create digital images, make sculptures and today try to find new ways to create art of reuse.

"1761393356:::2070384208:::Samuel Waxman Lopez:::Graduating with a degree in Business Administration from the Fritz Knoebel School of Hospitality at the University of Denver, my 10+ working in Hotels and Restaurants left me stressed and anxious on a continual basis. Looking to unwind and de-stress, a couple friends brought me to my first ever yoga class July 11, 2017. After a couple classes I knew that I wanted to make Yoga a cornerstone of my life. Practicing daily, Yoga helped calm my anxiety and reconnect with myself. Somewhere in those first weeks, most likely in the middle of class, I had a ""yogic epiphany"" and decided to leave the Hospitality Industry and enroll in the 200 HR Teacher Training program at the studio where I practiced. Drawn to the Teacher Training Program so that I could strengthen my practice, a passion for teaching began to blossom. Shortly after receiving my (RYT-200) certification in Wild Wisdom Vinyasa under the teaching of Jessie Dwiggins, I began to teach private (Vinyassa Flow) lessons as well as Chair Yoga at The Heritage at Sagewood Senior Living and Memory Support near Lincoln, NE.:::1081:::183:::0.07321428571428572:::0.2907738095238095:::1:::0:::2019|||"

I got into music at 15 when I got my first guitar. I had wanted one since my two sisters received acoustic guitars as presents. I wanted to be a rock star, and for the next 13 years, that was the goal I went after... but it never happened. I have terrible stage fright. Playing gigs was too much at the time, plus I had fallen in love with my lead singer and best friend. We married and eventually had two kids. My life changed, but it changed for the better. During all this, my dad found a place called The Conservatory of Recording Arts & Sciences. He was desperate that I learn a trade besides wanna-be rock star. I went, and am glad he found the school and encouraged me to go there. I love being a sound designer. After graduation and getting married, I started my career. I have had the privilege to work with many great people and companies. Being able to work on animation was just as good to me as being a rock star, though I still play almost every day. I have worked on several different projects, mostly for Disney and Warner Brothers. All have pushed me to be a better designer.:::1350:::258:::0.17017543859649123:::0.4133771929824561:::11:::70:::2012|||"

Now in 2019 Remembering Lions will be the fourth in the series.
My exposure to conservation issues since I started with that first book has made me determined then ever to try and raise funds to tackle the issues facing our wildlife rather than just sit back and moan.

Je travaille dans le cinéma depuis de nombreuses années sur des longs métrages. I’m Félix Baudouin, I’m the director of the film (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1291096/?ref_=rvi_nm ). I've been working in the Cinema industry for the last 20 years as an Assistant Director on French and International productions, in France and abroad. J'ai réalisé des films courts et des clips mélangeant des images réelles et de l’animation, des génériques et des habillages en animation. I’ve directed short-films, music videos mixing animation and real-life footage, animated credits and video design. Aujourd’hui, je suis là pour vous présenter mon nouveau projet, c’est un court métrage en dessin animé « Volutes des Anges », inspiré de la musique de Frédérique. C’est le premier film entièrement en dessin animé que j’écris et que je réalise et c’est ma première campagne de « crowdfunding ». I’m presenting to you our new project, an animated short-film untitled ""Volutes des Anges – Angels’ Volutes"", inspired by Frédérique d’Agata’s music. It’s my first fully animated film and it’s my first crowdfunding. Voici un exemple de mes précédents travaux: COSMIC69 (https://vimeo.com/user33019963). Je suis Frédérique d'Agata, je compose de la musique au piano depuis plus de 15 ans. C'est la troisième fois qu'une de mes compositions est utilisée dans un film, comme dans « L'odyssée d'un rêve », (https://ucarcapodyssee.wordpress.com/2009/09/03/la-video-de-larrivee/, http://www.lesechosdelaterre.com/europe/49-l-odyssee-d-un-reve.html), sur la traversée de l'Atlantique, une expédition à laquelle j'ai pris part. Avec ""Volutes des Anges"", pour la première fois, ma musique inspire un film. C'est une nouvelle expérience enrichissante et surprenante.
J'ai passé toute mon enfance sur le Bassin d'Arcachon et j'ai été profondément marquée par sa beauté et sa poésie. Cet environnement m'a naturellement amené vers le métier d'Ingénieur Océanographe. Cette nature dans laquelle j'évolue accompagne les évènements de ma vie, me donne de la force et inspire complètement ma musique.
Voici un exemple de mes oeuvres : ""Cosmic travel"", une composition de 2016 : https://youtu.be/ALmfmi0hrSg et https://youtu.be/7yzDpw2cuJ4. I’m Frédérique d’Agata, I’m the composer of ""Volutes des Anges – Angels’ Volutes"" which has inspired Félix for the film and is the score of the film. I’m composing since almost 15 years. This is the third time my music is in a film as in the movie ""L'odyssée d'un rêve"", (https://ucarcapodyssee.wordpress.com/2009/09/03/la-video-de-larrivee/, et http://www.lesechosdelaterre.com/europe/49-l-odyssee-d-un-reve.html) but for the first time my music actually inspires a film. This is a surprising and new experience for me.
Growing up on the ""Bassin d’Arcachon"" has had a profound impact on me. My music is much inspired by these landscapes full of great beauty and poetry. Nature is a big part of my life, it inspires me, it gives me comfort and strength. I naturally became an oceanographer engineer and a biology teacher. Here is an example of my previous work: ""Cosmic travel"", a composition of 2016 : https://youtu.be/ALmfmi0hrSg et https://youtu.be/7yzDpw2cuJ4 .:::3250:::519:::0.021590909090909088:::0.16423160173160173:::1:::2:::2019|||"

"47744432:::1638441237:::Chris Wilkins:::I live in Kenilworth in the heart of central England with my wife and 3 children. We have a tortoise and 3 small aquariums full of Sea Monkeys.

My life has always involved gaming since I can remember - my first computer was a Sinclair ZX Spectrum which Santa brought to me one Christmas Eve back in the 80's. Since that snow laden festive time I have had an affiliation with most consoles and computers released in the UK since and fondly remember the other distractions of the time - the toys, the adverts, the American TV shows, the sweets to name but a few.

Even though appreciating the art of current games and the sparkly new consoles they are played on, I fondly recall the older systems and titles I have played over the years. As I get older, there is more history to look back on

A good few years ago, when there were a few less grey hairs, I organised a retro gaming event for charity - this involved taking over a large cricket club venue down the road from where I live and filling it with arcade machines, pinball tables and every console and computer I could get my hands on. I announced the event, sold some tickets and hoped people would turn up on the day which they thankfully did. As a momento, I produced a 28 page magazine I called Retro Fusion and gave it to those who came along. This very act started my interest in magazine publishing both in the print and online world.

Issue 1 and 2 of Retro Fusion was distributed in the Gamestation chain of stores in the UK - somewhat a coup at the time. Issue 3 was always planned, but unfortunately due to a number of conflicting events in my life at that time, never materialised - this was 6 years ago.

So as well as now being a little older, the Playstation 2 in some circles is now also deemed retro!

Issue 3 and 4 now exists - thus onto my next project.:::1841:::342:::0.043021246430337334:::0.2324890387390387:::17:::113:::2011|||"

"2016825575:::1460898831:::Superior Small Batch:::Superior Small Batch was born on a Fall morning along Highway 8, between the Twin Cities and Ojibwa, Wisconsin. We had been visiting friends in Saint Paul and were on our way back to Ojibwa to pick up a final load of furniture for our move north to an old Finnish homestead in the Superior National Forest north of Duluth. The conversation turned toward the food projects we were excited to embark on once we were settled. As our excitement grew, an idea began to gel. Why not form a food company? Between us, we had considerable commercial food experience -- Gail had worked as a cook at a community kitchen, a baker of European hearth breads, and had helped design a food rescue program in Southern Indiana. Shane had worked for years in commercial kitchens and as a self-employed caterer. Why not give it a try?

With a lot of hard work and the encouragement of good friends, the plan began to come together. We went through a period of trial and experimentation to refine our recipes, develop workable manufacturing practices, and generally lay the groundwork for Superior Small Batch. We enrolled our friends in the testing process, and with their help, decided to focus on vegan sausage and burgers which can now be found in locations around northern Minnesota and Wisconsin.:::1283:::222:::0.1087121212121212:::0.2916666666666667:::1:::0:::2019|||"

For the years, I have loved, shared and created comics and art in many different ways. I started with a soft launch of Naughty Faeries, which was very well received. Kickstarter became my opportunity to start the next chapter in my life, comic creator and publisher with more people, beautiful artwork from some of my favorite artists and get more exposure to a project that I really enjoyed working on, with a team of incredibly talented people.

This past summer, Naughty Faeries Stripper Assassins, was successful funded in our first Kickstarter campaign, thanks to the amazing backers who have made it possible. Thank you so much for your support.

In January 2019, we launched a Kickstarter Make 100 campaign for Alex Kotkin's cover from our first Kickstarter, which were silver foil Embossed 8x10 prints, which was successfully funded in a couple hours.

The third Kickstarter, will continue the story of ""Naughty Faeries Stripper Assassins"" comic series, book 2 ""Balor's Rath.""

Our fourth Kickstarter, The Art of Naughty Faeries. This book collected the concepts, artwork, sketches, covers and stories for the first 2 books, with sneak peaks and book three.

Naughty Faeries Stripper Assassins #3 was our most successful kickstarter to date! We beat all the records and exceeded our expectations. We hope you can join us and support this journey in to the grimdark fantasy world of Naughty Stripper Faeries. This is a Special Kikcstarter for virtural Comic Con with the Naughty Faeries Theme. We are featuring various artists who have been involved int he project and offering unique items at their Artist Alley tables (pledge levels).

Whether it was playing in the dirt, snow, and water or having my Joes rappel from trees, G.I.Joe ® allowed me to use my imagination and create different worlds and storylines while I played. It was a world where good always triumphed over evil. I know this holds true not only for me, but for many children from this time period! One of the things that appealed to me and others as a child was the animated illustrations of the characters and vehicles on the packaging. With their vibrant colors and action poses, I was immediately drawn to a character or vehicle and continued to go back for more!! What many do not know is the amount of passion and hard work that occurred behind the scenes prior to Joe product ever hitting store shelves. As I shared earlier, this book is my way of saying Thank You to what some may call a “toy”, but carries a deeper meaning for myself and others like me. I look forward to passing on this love for G.I.Joe ® not only to my son, but to future generations!:::1083:::204:::0.10143022486772485:::0.49242724867724863:::6:::10:::2015|||"

"1999468336:::438192311:::Sudan Corinne:::Qui suis-je pour me permettre de supposer que bon nombre
d’adolescents par delà le monde utiliseront Extase comme livre
de chevet ?
Je suis une femme qui a passé plus de dix
ans vêtue d’un manteau thérapeutique,
accompagnant des patients pour la plupart
adolescents. Ils arrivaient devant moi gorgés
de souffrance et ce, en partie dû au passage
de l’enfance à celui d’adulte. Un couloir qui
peut s’avérer long, sombre, sinueux et dans
lequel la lumière ne parvient pas toujours à
se répandre…
C’est en 2013, suite à un rêve, que ma vie a basculé du côté de
l’écriture. Je me suis surprise à avoir assez d’audace pour faire
de mes rêves une réalité.
J’ai commencé par lire L’attrape-coeurs de J.D. Salinger. Suite à
sa lecture, je me suis dit qu’il était temps d’écrire.
L’idée première fût d’utiliser mes années d’expérience dans la
thérapie alternative, afin de parvenir à soutenir les adolescents
par le biais de l’écriture. Faire parler un jeune en incluant la
musique, le skate, l’amour et le sexe… pourrait permettre aux
lecteurs de grandir en tant qu’individus à une période où ils
rejettent l’adulte et ainsi pouvoir s’identifier en fonction de leur
époque.
L’homosexualité qui se profile à cet âge où l’identification de soi
est plus ou moins compliquée mais néanmoins primordiale, est
un des sujets phare de cette histoire.
L’alcool et le cannabis sont mis en avant, non pas pour les
promouvoir… A dire vrai, ce sont des thèmes importants aux
yeux des jeunes, et le but est qu’ils parviennent à se familiariser
avec leurs propres limites.
Ayant des enfants du même âge, je me suis inspirée de leur
langage pour me transformer en parfaite adolescente sans
oublier de me vêtir d’un vêtement masculin.
J’ai tout de même mis quatre ans à m’installer dans la peau
d’un adolescent, à me positionner dans celle d’un garçon et à
me retrouver dans l’empire du musicien.
Du Montreux Jazz Festival en passant par Paris, Bristol,
Washington DC, jusqu’à me poser à San Francisco, pour revenir à
la source dans la ville où je suis née… Bienne.
Tout au long de ce parcours, j’ai eu l’opportunité
de redécouvrir de vieux groupes, qui tous ont
inspiré des instants clés dans l’écriture.
Au Zénith à Paris, je me retrouve devant la
scène ; mes yeux ne quittent pas Slash et son
jeu de guitare. Sa prestation étale à la perfection
mes écrits concernant l’union du musicien avec
son instrument. Des moments magiques qui
m’invitent à continuer sur ce chemin non moins
périlleux, mais tellement riche en émotions.
En effet, la musique fait partie intégrante d’Extase. Petit à petit,
je lâche mon métier de thérapeute pour me consacrer
uniquement à l’écriture.
Le texte s’écrit aux rythmes des guitares, des toms et des
cymbales. L’inspiration et les images me viennent pendant et
après les concerts.
En janvier 2015, je m’envole pour San
Francisco dans le but d’offrir mon manuscrit
au « père » de ce roman, sans qui, cette
histoire n’aurait jamais vu le jour.
Je me fie à mon ressenti et me retrouve dans
une ville inconnue, Oakland, proche de San
Francisco, à la recherche d’une « Rock Star ».
De fil en aiguille et de rencontres en rencontres, je me retrouve
au « 924 Gilman Street ». Local dans lequel la musique Punk
Rock est reine. Adolescents Green Day aimaient se produire sur
cette scène. D’ailleurs, peu après mon passage, ils ont organisé
un concert en mémoire… du passé ? C’est dans ces murs que je
me vois offrir l’adresse de mon mentor.
« Un joli clin d’oeil de la vie. »
La veille de mon retour à Genève, je m’enveloppe de bravoure
afin d’aller frapper à sa porte, en étant uniquement moi-même.
C’est ainsi que je parviens à lui remettre mon manuscrit.
C’est à Lausanne, aux Docks après le concert de Wolfmother,
que je me dis qu’il est grand temps de me retrouver au centre de
mon histoire. Entrer en contact avec des groupes locaux afin
qu’ils m’ouvrent les portes des Backstages.
Je fais en sorte d’obtenir un
rendez-vous avec Marc Ridet
programmateur musical et
directeur artistique, basé à
Nyon. Après une conversation
tournant autour de ma trilogie
et du besoin de me retrouver au
coeur de celle-ci, Monsieur Ridet
décide de m’ouvrir son carnet
d’adresse. Il me remet quelques
noms d’artistes susceptibles de
m’aider dans ma recherche.
Dirthy Sound Magnet et The Two m’ouvrent leurs coeurs et la
porte des coulisses. C’est à Bienne que je rencontre Basement
Saints un groupe rock Soleurois. Eux aussi se prêtent au jeu et
m’invitent dans leur local, basé à Grange.
Tous m’ont accueillie dans le noyau de leur groupe afin que je
puisse m’identifier à mon personnage.
En 2017, suite au refus de plusieurs maisons d’édition, je
décide de m’auto éditer, mais avant, j’envoie mon manuscrit à
quelques adolescents, car en fin de compte, c’est pour eux que
j’écris. Ils furent enthousiastes et m’aidèrent à « améliorer » le
vocabulaire jeune de l’histoire.
Novembre 2017, Auto édition chez Amazon. Décembre, premier
passage à la TV Bilingue à Bienne.

I’ve always had multiple art modalities going at a time. I grew up being told by society and the people around me that artists don’t make money until after they die, and you have to have another job if you plan on making art. Art, writing, and music have always been my tools when life has gone awry to find myself again in all the chaos. This book and these pieces of art were all made while I learned to heal from PTSD and centuries of repressed grief. These prose, and works of art are a precious part of my soul, each has been a gift to me, and my goal is that they will connect you to a piece of yourself you thought was lost. That you’ll be inspired to work through the darkness in your life, and pull yourself through as I have, with the support of others, and these tools of inspiration. Our minds are plagued by corrupted coding when we experience depression, hate, fear, self loathing, and anxiety... and there is a way out of those thoughts aka corrupted codes. Writing and creating art, while getting support from professional coaches, practitioners and therapists all has brought me to this amazing place. Where I get to share what I’ve learned with you, to inspire you, and motivate you to own your weird, dark, crazy bits of yourself, and find freedom in the truth.

"1525754260:::2007791734:::Sarah Constable:::My name is Sarah Constable and I am an Illustrator. It can be hard to write about who we are and what our new companies are and that is why this will only scrape the surface. To get to know me better you would have to buy my new book!
I am an ambitious 20 year old determined to make my mark in the world of illustration. At current I study Illustration and Animation at Coventry University. Inspired by my Grandmother I chose this career path however, this project is inspired by the people I have met along the way. My style is defined as line art. Within this definition the artist uses bold straight or curved lines without any shading but instead with cross hatching to enhance the image. Pointillism also features within my work as it couples extremely well with line art to create a depth within the piece. Often the pieces are small in scale no bigger than A6. These are normally sketched in a random location during a spell of inspiration. An example of this is the few drawings inspired by my American travels in 2017 which depict the Chrysler, Sea turtles and ocean waves. Experimenting with everything from spray paints to charcoal my style is still very much in fluctuation. The current future focus for myself is looking to a preferred career in either cartoon animation or children’s book illustration. In the art world having one label is not a constant and who we are or where we place ourselves changes so often. At current I place myself as a practising amateur illustrator.
But this project isn’t about who I am. This is about the people I have met, the people we see splattered across the news weekly and those who aren’t known yet and who suffer in silence. This is why I have created my latest project – Brave Art SC.
Brave art isn’t just me, myself and I.
This idea was started in 2012 when advised to share my work a friend pointed me towards a site called Teenhelp. Upon this site I watched as my words impacted, helped and moved other sufferers. This gave me a sense of purpose. It is that purpose that inspired me for this project. This is an amazing opportunity to reach out to others across a wider audience. Drawing and word play have always been my most powerful expressive outlets. Channelling experiences and stories from the masses into a creative outlet can help one to cope and release some of that emotional baggage that haunts them. One day in a future project I hope to collect other stories and individual displays of art to share with you all and open our eyes to the facts of life. Yes, we struggle but the amazing thing about those who struggle is that we don’t hear about the real success stories. Those are the stories that should be shouted across the tallest rooftops. I hope to do them justice within this challenging project.:::2779:::513:::0.12736518409905506:::0.39717416096448355:::1:::0:::2019|||"

"1088669712:::414731577:::Michael Shapiro:::Michael Jeffrey Shapiro (born February 1, 1951) is a noted American composer and conductor.

The son of a Klezmer band clarinetist, Michael Shapiro was born in Brooklyn, New York, and spent most of his high school years in Baldwin, a Long Island suburb. The winner of several piano competitions during his youth, he earned his B.A. at Columbia College, Columbia University, where he majored in English literature and concentrated in music, benefiting most—according to his own assessment—from some of the department’s stellar musicology faculty, which, at that time, included such international luminaries as Paul Henry Lang, Denis Stevens, Joel Newman, and others. He studied conducting independently with Carl Bamberger at the Mannes College of Music in New York. At The Juilliard School, where he earned his master’s degree, he studied solfège and score reading with the renowned Mme. Renée Longy—known to generations of Juilliard students as “the infamous madame of dictation” for her rigorous demands and classic pedagogic methods—and composition with Vincent Persichetti. His most influential composition teacher, however, was Elie Siegmeister, with whom he studied privately.

Since 2002 Shapiro has been the music director and conductor of the Chappaqua Orchestra in New York’s Westchester County, which he conducted for the world premiere of his score for the classic 1931 film Frankenstein (directed by James Whale and starring Boris Karloff) (which has since its premiere received over a dozen productions nationally) as well as for the world premiere of his own orchestral work, Roller Coaster, which received its West Coast premiere under the baton of Marin Alsop in 2010 at the Cabrillo Festival of Contemporary Music while Shapiro was a composer in residence. He served for two years as the music consultant to the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, D.C., where he produced and performed music by a number of composers who were either murdered by the Germans and their collaborators or had survived as refugees from the Third Reich. He has also been the assistant conductor at the Zurich Opera Studio.

Shapiro’s works, which in the aggregate address nearly every medium, have been performed widely throughout the United States, Canada, and Europe—with broadcasts of premieres on National Public Radio, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, the Israel Broadcasting Authority, Sender Freies Berlin, WQXR, and WCBS-TV. His music has been characterized in a New York Times review as “possessing a rare melodic gift.” His oeuvre includes more than one hundred works for solo voice, piano, chamber ensembles, chorus, orchestra, as well as for opera, film, and television.

Shapiro has received awards and grants from Martha Baird Rockefeller Composer’s Assistance, Meet the Composer, the Henry Evans Traveling Fellowship of Columbia University, and the Boris Koutzen Memorial Fund. He has also received the Columbian Award and the Sigma Alpha Iota Composers Competition prize. He is the author of Jewish Pride and of The Jewish 100, which has been published in British, Japanese, Chinese, Russian, Portuguese, Bulgarian, Polish, and Romanian editions—in addition to its original American release.

Shapiro has collaborated with such artists as Teresa Stratas, Jose Ferrer, Janos Starker, Sir Malcolm Arnold, Marin Alsop, Sergiu Comissiona, Eugene Drucker, Kim Cattrall, Tim Fain, Gottfried Wagner, Alexis Cole, Edward Arron, Jerome Rose, Mariko Anraku, John Fullam, Jose Ramos Santana, Clamma Dale, Anita Darian, Florence Levitt, Kikuei Ikeda, Ayako Yoshida, Harris Poor, John Edward Niles, David Leibowitz, Robert Tomaro, Kathryn Amyotte, James Allen Anderson, Glen Hemberger, Anthony LaGruth, and Emily Wong, and organizations such as the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra in the UK, Houston Symphony Orchestra, Virginia Symphony Orchestra, United States Navy Band, West Point Band's The Jazz Knights, Dallas Winds, Springfield Symphony Orchestra, Traverse Symphony Orchestra, New York Repertory Orchestra, Rock River Symphony, Garden State Philharmonic, Opera Theatre of Northern Virginia, International Opera Center at the Zurich Opera, United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, American Jewish Committee, Hawthorne String Quartet, Locrian Chamber Ensemble, Amernet String Quartet, Artemis, Cabrillo Festival of Contemporary Music, Bergen Norway International Festival, and Dateline NBC, and universities in New York, Louisiana, Ohio, Delaware, Florida, and Tennessee.:::4516:::681:::0.06600928401663694:::0.2245756090314914:::2:::1:::2014|||"

I attended Long Beach City College to further my studies in fine art. My ultimate goal is to use all my elements in art to show how powerful it is to feel. Emotion within the art community is something that has been overlooked for some time now and I want to be apart of bringing back the feel.:::944:::180:::0.2267070707070707:::0.48283333333333334:::1:::0:::2017|||"

"1528863703:::1936231722:::John Sanger:::Rarely does a musician embark on a sonic journey with such radiant fervency like John Sanger has. A West Michigan-native, John has traveled the country and immersed himself in the experiences life has to offer. During the hard times John found himself reflecting upon his boyhood affinity for the beauty and wonders of the Great Lakes which soothed the occasional nights of lonely dreams and daily struggles. John Sanger’s songs reflect Americana themes we idolized as children contrasted with the reality check of adulthood. The roller-coaster of life’s trials and tribulations are answered with John’s mantra “life didn’t come with a play book so don’t be hard on yourself” and the essence of the John Sanger music experience. From the realization a relationship is lost and will never come back to offering apologies and asking repentance for poor decisions to the elation of knowing everything will be alright, John captures life’s moments as a reflection and relating in his songs.:::986:::174:::-0.043333333333333335:::0.32749999999999996:::1:::2:::2016|||"

I minored in Studio Art in college, and recently have returned to school to earn an Associates Degree in Studio Art. Every art project I do sparks a sense of excitement and possibility in me.

I launched a quilting and pattern design company, Elizabeth Anne, in 1999, and I currently work as a quilting teacher, pattern designer and longarm quilter. Art has been my passion since I was 5 years old, and I love to explore many different media, including painting, jewelry making, print making, ceramics and upcycling.

Art is also my sanity. As the mother of three children, ages 16, 13 and 8, art offers an escape to a zen-like place for me. I live and breathe art! I would like to be able to focus more of my time learning new techniques and skills by taking classes and local workshops. I am also hoping to establish myself as a working artist in the coming years. By pledging me on this campaign, it is not only confirming my artistic ability, but helping me to raise funds toward these goals.

She has exhibited with galleries and museums on both continents (among many others: the Los Gatos Museum, the SF MOMA Artists’ Gallery, Living with Art Gallery in NYC, la Galerie des Saint-Pères in Paris France, David Himmelberger Gallery in San Francisco, and soon Art ventures Gallery in Menlo Park). She won numerous awards and Prizes in Europe as well as in the US. Her work can be found in major collections, both private and public, in the US, France, Japan, and many other countries.
“My artistic journey is one of light and hope. I always choose subjects that have both exquisite
beauty and deep meaning. My paintings illustrate a heavenly world filled with magnificent creatures and seeds, which transform into whimsical plants and lush gardens. I work with many layers that metaphorically represent the splendor of our humanity. As the layers come together, they form a magnificent whole that represents each human's individual beauty, and the interactions between different creatures or bubbles within a painting demonstrate unity among a community, as humans and nature become one. My paintings often connect with the viewer on a very deep emotional level.”
Besides her studio work Flo de Bretagne has painted more than 100 murals at various schools throughout the Bay Area, and will “export” her mural skills to a French castle this summer and to other countries in the next few years.:::1501:::252:::0.22160416666666669:::0.4768958333333333:::1:::1:::2011|||"

Our kids' school went nut-free and suddenly I had to accommodate those restrictions as well! I discovered that there wasn't a company making nutritious convenience foods that were ""free from"" multiple common problematic ingredients, like gluten, nuts and dairy. So we decided to start a superfood-based company to meet the needs of all the Free From people out there, whether you are a gluten free vegan or allergic to the top 8 allergens or trying to eat grain and dairy free (a tough combo!).

Since we started ZEGO, I've handled every aspect of the business, from accounting to sales to marketing to recipe development, even teaching myself design to do the packaging. Prior to ZEGO, I worked for Congress and nonprofits to improve nutrition for low-income kids and started a nonprofit called A Better Course that continues to do that work to this day (www.abettercourse.org).

No one understands this more deeply than the Nashville-based singer-songwriter, who is also an Advanced Heart Failure/Heart Transplant cardiologist at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. After years of working hard for success in the medical field, Brown discovered a relentless pull towards music that has now yielded five albums, a succession of songwriting awards, featured placement of her music at retailers like Starbucks and the Gap, and invitations to TEDMED and other conferences around the country to speak about finding a vulnerability through music that makes her a better doctor.

Montreal-born and Boston-raised, Brown wrote her first song while in a research fellowship at the University of Pennsylvania and launched her musical career in Philadelphia, releasing three solo albums. In 2014 she moved to Nashville, where along with her work at Vanderbilt, she found a community of co-writers and collaborators that pushed her writing even further. She has since released two more albums and had two daughters, making her pursuit of balance and reflection all that much more important.

Her new album was born in that space of uncertain transition followed by confident calm--she no longer feels the need to choose one part of herself over another. “For the first time in my life, I don't feel like I'm working towards something else,” she says. “When someone asks me what I want to do in five years, I kind of just want to keep doing this.”:::1517:::254:::0.31072390572390574:::0.534882154882155:::1:::6:::2018|||"

There is simply no better gourmet pleasure than having quality food and ingredients from the actual country of origin at the peak of their flavour. I have grown up with spices and herbs around me and some pretty amazing home cooking that has inspired to cook and share the passion with others. Through my travels, I came across some pretty amazing herbs and spices and was inspired by the intensity of aroma and flavour, and thought, these are superior to the spices we find in the supermarkets in the UK. It was then that I decided to create Zest & Zing (end of 2016) following almost 20 years in sales/business development in the oil industry and follow my passion for food. I started selling spices online (on my website), and in local markets in London. My passion for food and spices, comes across, and I love to give recommendations on what to cook the spices with.

After receiving a BFA from NYU, he worked freelance for other photographers and himself for several years before finding full time employment in the department from which he graduated.

"123988303:::695599431:::Paul Bielaczyc:::Brothers Michael and Paul Bielaczyc co-founded Aradani Studios in 2002 (along with their sister Sara), and have been working as professional artists for over a decade. Together they have won numerous awards at various conventions over the years, and have been published in DragonLance, White Wolf, and Apex Digest. Paul is a licensed Wheel of Time artist. They travel around the country, showcasing their work at science fiction conventions and Renaissance Festivals, as well as professional art galleries in the Nashville area. Michael graduated in 2007 from Watkins College or Art and Design in Nashville, TN, with his BFA. His final thesis was a massive installation, involving furniture, ceramics, digital video, and sculpture. This piece was influential in shaping one of his current pursuits in art, as Michael enjoys making art that questions what is otherwise accepted as normal, the things society just shrugs off. His current work, done primarily in oils and acrylics, are playful and colorful, with swirling shapes and objects, but mask a much more serious underlying theme, which Michael will gladly discuss if you inquire. Not to say he doesn't dabble in the fantastically mundane, i.e. dragons, wizards, and zombies, as he has been a avid gamer for almost as long as he has been making art. Paul began his art career quite differently, as his path began while he was earning his Masters in Computer Science from Vanderbilt. Upon graduation, he joined forces with Michael to form Aradani Studios (and their sister Sara!), and hasn't looked back. His subject matter runs the spectrum, from dark horrors that haunt the unsuspecting, to playful tongue-in-cheek parodies and the absurd. Paul works mostly in charcoal and pastel, using the rich blacks of charcoal to truly give his wicked pieces their dark, foreboding presence, and pastels when he needs a little color in his day. In 2006, Paul was the winner of the Chesley Award for Best Monochrome Unpublished, for his charcoal piece Nightmare. Most recently he has been doing independent commissions, hired by the collectors he has met at the various shows.

As if their art career was not enough, they also own and run one of the most respected costume and prosthetic businesses within fandom. Providing custom costumes, masks and of course the ever popular elf ears, their creations are known worldwide. Aradani Studios elf ears have also been featured in many larger productions, from Maria Carrey's Christmas Day Float and G4 TV's Avatar skits featuring Olivia Munn, to a web production featuring Larry Elmore and Margaret Weis. Aradani Studios has been a family run business since 2002, bringing the strange and fantastic to life for fans and pros alike.:::2724:::447:::0.13404431216931215:::0.3866732804232804:::3:::4:::2012|||"

Fresh out of high school, I borrowed a camera to photograph my first wedding. I don't recommend that. Since then I married, graduated from CU at Boulder with a BA in Education, became a mom and now a grandma. Photography has always been part of my life whether as a pro photographing weddings or family events. Until 12 years ago my portfolio consisted of mostly people, animals and a few landscapes. It all changed when I realized I had missed capturing the beauty of my own backyard. This new passion for fine art photography has allowed my the opportunity to show in the Tucson International Airport twice and the honor of showing in The De Grazia Gallery in the Sun Little Gallery.

"717028406:::1621892835:::Kathy Sherman Suder:::Kathy Suder first major series of work on boxers, KNOCKOUT, as described by The New Yorker, “owe more to Caravaggio than to Sports Illustrated"". Exhibited in Fort Worth, New York, and at Paris Photo, KNOCKOUT marked Suder’s arrival on the U.S. art scene as an image maker of unusual emotional and visual power.

It’s clear that almost two decades as an oil painter informs her photography. Before working as a visual artist, Suder designed and painted children’s furniture, as owner of FUN-iture, that was featured in Neiman Marcus,FAO Swartz, and Spiegels Christmas Catalogs in addition to In Style Magazine.
Suder’s other series of work have chronicled the street life and domesticity of Paris, Havana, Morocco and Coney Island; a medical mission in Guatemala; religious festivals in Sicily; portraits of breast cancer survivors; and life on the Subway in New York, London, Paris and Tokyo. Diverse as these contexts are, Suder’s images maintain a sensitivity to subjects in extremes of physical, emotional and social tension. She especially latches onto moments of vulnerability and, in UNDERGROUND, creates encounters that make her an active participant in her images.

Her work has been included in three thematic museum exhibitions in the United States and in 2015 was the subject of the solo exhibition UNDERGROUND: Photographs by Kathy Sherman Suder at the Amon Carter Museum of American Art in Fort Worth, TX. Acquired by a number of major private collectors, her photographs are also in the permanent collections of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA), the Amon Carter Museum of American Art and the Pérez Art Museum Miami. Her book, UNDERGROUND: LONDON•TOYKO•NEW YORK, which accompanied the exhibition, won accolades and competitions.:::1759:::290:::0.0461395202020202:::0.30541215728715726:::1:::0:::2010|||"

"858662315:::1723400995:::Brett Westgrove:::Growing up in a largely non-musical family, in the farm-country of central Wisconsin, Brett stood out by developing a deep passion for music at a young age. He was singing as soon as he could talk, on the piano at age two, and playing guitar by ten. Brett stayed involved in everything musical and consistently positioned himself in front of any audience he could find and never failed to capture attention with his passion.

Shortly after high school, Brett moved to California where he worked as lead-engineer and producer for a commercial recording studio and production house, by day, and an acoustic, pop-music performer by night. After realizing the CA music scene was not the right place for him, he decided to take some time from the stage and explore some of his other passions. He moved to Colorado where he earned a Master’s Degree in Aerospace engineering, from the University of Colorado and worked as a spacecraft controller for NASA space missions. However upon completion of his schooling, Brett once again found himself face-to-face with the fact that he was never meant to do anything but bring music to the world. This realization resulted in a powerful return to music as one of few rocket scientists in the country genre.

Following a return to his roots in the country music genre, Brett found his way to Nashville, in the Spring of 2017, where he plays as both a solo and band-backed artist. Westgrove is currently writing and recording his first album for an early 2019 release, and booking tour dates for all of 2019!:::1546:::267:::0.05539285714285713:::0.2282777777777778:::1:::0:::2019|||"

"1241791799:::1577792663:::kj52:::Sometimes it takes a fork in the road to help you see who you truly are. And after sixteen years, hundreds of shows, and hundreds of thousands of lives affected by the music of KJ52, Jonah Sorrentino has emerged with a brand new perspective, sound, and soul. Jonah, KJ52’s triumph in candor and personal reflection, is a succinct breeze of raw energy in the form of eight tracks. That Sorrentino took of the mask of his stage name for this album and chapter is no accident…he has hit the reset button on his career and emerged with a whole new persona: himself.
“The best way to describe Jonah, is like this: Take an old trusty Macbook Pro (thats me), and add several current software updates. This album is a transparent look at my life, looking back, looking forward and looking inward. It’s everything my fans love about me in an updated package.” Sorrentino has streamlined his career in every way to embrace the new face of the music industry. Instead of going the traditional label route, he has joined the legion of artists who are crowdfunding their releases and going it alone. 52 Records, Jonah’s own label, is a brand new entity created for the new album and meant to connect more closely with his core audience. He explains, “I’m coming off two years of the hardest choices I’ve faced financially, spiritually and career-wise. I feel renewed from a creative stand point and feel like I’m in the best place Ive been in years. My workload has doubled but my passion for what I do is 7000 times higher.”

Musically speaking, there is no filler on this release. Though the record comes in at a lean thirty minutes even, there are no album tracks. If only more artists would approach their craft this way; eight singles equates to a much more listenable release than three singles and nine filler tracks. Truly, audiences will find it difficult to identify one, single weak point on Jonah. And these songs are as uplifting as they are infectious, as thought-provoking as they are honest. True to the precedent he set very early in his career, KJ presents spiritual truth with clever rhymes, from a unique perspective. Only this time he does it with a vulnerability previously unheard. And at the core is one central message: God will go before you, through all stages of life, through every up and down, if you are willing to believe. And within this overarching, career-spanning theme, he is as diverse as they come in terms of song to song thematics. On “Hold on,” KJ addresses his younger self at three different points in his life, offering advice to hold steady and never give up hope: This is all about to change, know there’s a better way. Roll with the punches, you can hold for a better day. On “Get down, Get Down” Sorrentino addresses some of the more awkward moments in his career: Pull up to the curb in my ’05, got the rims on tens as I roll by. No Benz, but I’ve got ten friends in an old ride…fanny pack and strapped for the hole night. And on “Day Job,” Jonah reflects on his decision to pursue music as a career the decade and a half, keeping his eyes on the larger purpose of his music: What if I never quit my day job, just pulled a nine to five trying to get the cake off? Would the ones that you saved have strayed off? Always personal, always candid, KJ will have you listening attentively as he spins yarns and spouts humorously.

Jonah Sorrentino has averaged 150 shows per years every single year of his career. He tours relentlessly without rest, always maintaining his reputation as one of the most visible hip-hop artists in the industry. He has shared the stage with everyone from Lecrae to Toby Mac to Andy Mineo. In support of Jonah, his plan is to take it upon himself to share these songs more fervently than at any point in his career, and to use the past sixteen years of stories to shed true light on others.

“This album is, when you boil it down, about the things Ive seen God showing me. It reflects a desire to be very transparent, more so than I ever have. These days, I’m way more comfortable in my own skin. I’ve found a balance between what I love about hip hop and what I love about being myself, and I feel this project is the strongest one I’ve done in years. Hopefully I can use my personal experiences grab someone’s attention and be able to point them to something that has hope, life and so much more.”:::4368:::829:::0.16429405676627895:::0.39555196449640895:::3:::2:::2017|||"

"750516837:::1376351746:::Lone Star Wind Orchestra:::The Lone Star Wind Orchestra (LSWO) was founded in April 2006 by Robert Clark, Barry Knezek, and Christopher Tucker. The driving force behind forming this performing ensemble was the collective agreement between the founders to build an orchestra from a player’s perspective and be a vital participant in the North Texas arts community. The founders were in agreement that the organization needed to focus on these core values: making the best possible music, giving back to the community, and reaching out to the under-served. The LSWO performs classical transcriptions, chamber music, and contemporary wind band literature in some of the finest performance halls available, primarily the Morton H. Meyerson Symphony Center, the Charles W. Eisemann Center, and Moody Performance Hall.

"1936923196:::100441343:::Myron Silberstein:::Acclaimed by Paul Snook of Fanfare as “a deeply adventurous and accomplished pianist” and by Aaron Hunt of NewCity Stage as an “expert accompanist,” Myron Silberstein has enjoyed a career as a solo pianist, accompanist, composer, and educator for nearly 30 years. He won the borsa di studio at the 1991 Giornate Musicali Festival, made a full-length European debut in 1992, and a New York debut at Weill Recital Hall of Carnegie Hall in 1993. Mr. Silberstein’s discography includes recordings for Connoisseur Society, Naxos, and Centaur Records. Myron Silberstein is a lifelong advocate of underrepresented repertoire. His recording of works by Peter Mennin and Norman Lloyd was hailed by Mark Lehman of The American Record Guide as “an indispensable addition to the discography of American music.” His recording of piano works by Vincent Persichetti was noted by Colin Clarke as “a really vital disc.” Mr. Silberstein has served as staff accompanist for the annual Classical Singer Magazine Convention since 2009, was resident music director of Chicago Opera Vanguard from 2009 to 2011, and was nominated for a Jeff Award in music direction in 2011. His extensive catalog of compositions, both for concert performance and musical theatre, reflect the traditional aesthetic and emotional concerns of the repertoire for which he advocates as a performer. In his spare time, Myron Silberstein writes fiction and learns dead languages.:::1432:::235:::0.025937950937950933:::0.37347041847041845:::3:::1:::2011|||"

"245440329:::1189494570:::Akabaka:::I am an independent developer who originally created Chromatose as a tabletop campaign for my friends in 2014. After spending so much time with the characters and the world, I was disappointed that I wouldn't be able to share the story with anyone else once the campaign ended. As much as I would love to, it would be impossible for me to run this campaign for every single person who was interested, so I figured the best way to present the story publicly would be through a visual novel-like format. Visual novels, however, do not allow players to engage with the characters and world on their own terms as they would be able to in a roleplay experience, and interaction with the story is often limited to few-and-far-between, sometimes trivial, in-text decisions. Drawing inspiration from my all-time favorite game, Catherine (ATLUS), I aimed to tell the story of Chromatose through an immersive visual novel-RPG hybrid loaded with enough gameplay and meaningful decisions to replicate the feeling of me directly interacting with the player. Development formally started on Chromatose in October 2017, and a 3 hour demo was publicly released in October 2018. The game is currently in active development.:::1206:::200:::0.05894746787603932:::0.3939862055933485:::1:::1:::2019|||"

Bill Webb has over 300 books to his credit—
writing, developing and directing the creation of over 150,000 pages of fantasy RPG material as the creative director. His best known works include Rappan Athuk, The Sword of Air, The Slumbering Tsar Saga, Tome of Horrors, Wilderlands of High Fantasy, Dungeon of Graves, Demons and Devils, the Crucible of Freya, and The Lost City of Barakus (with WDB Kenower). His works have won several ENnie Awards.

Matt Finch is the ENnie-award winning author of Swords & Wizardry, the simulacrum/clone of the 1974 Original Edition rule-set. He is also the author of the (somewhat infamous) Quick Primer for Old School Gaming along with several adventure modules and gaming resources.

Chuck Wright worked with Necromancer Games on some of their free products as well as cover layouts and layout & typesetting before becoming the layout and Art Director for Frog God Games. The most well known of these would be the Gold ENnie award-winning ""The Lost City of Barakus"". He also donates his spare time on the site D20PFSRD.com converting (and eventually creating) creatures for The Pathfinder Role Playing Game.

Zach Glazar was a little of everything before launching a kickstarter under his own small press company, Lesser Gnome for Whisper & Venom in 2013. Whisper & Venom and its follow-up, Death & Taxes, were Ennie nominated and well-received box sets stuffed with everything from books to dice to figurines. Zach became a partner at Frog God Games in 2016.

Michael Badolato joined Frog God Games in 2017 as customer service manager bringing a long life of experience with games, shipping and gamer gatherings with him.

Edwin Nagy, the Fifth Edition Coordinator, made himself so indispensable that he went ahead and became a partner at Frog God Games.

All Frog God projects on Kickstarter and beyond would not be possible without the tireless efforts of both John ""Pexx"" Barnhouse and Jerry Baker who are more visible and active than those who should know better.:::2160:::350:::0.16220833333333334:::0.47133333333333344:::26:::44:::2012|||"

We at T Watches have tackled this problem by producing a range of SWISS MADE watches that are superb quality yet still affordable to everyone. By limiting the numbers of watches produced for each watch collection, they also retain that exclusivity we all desire.

There is a famous saying “class never goes out of style” and our watches are classic in style with timeless design cues that will still look good on the wrist in 20 or 30 years time.

"201206010:::1373414007:::Banshee:::Banshee are an alternative rock band based in Glasgow, Scotland.
Geared up by roaring guitars, exceptional arrangements and a powerful female vocal fuelled with high energy performances.

Since their formation, Banshee have built strength upon strength developing their musical style, musicianship and craft whilst bringing the very best to audiences at their live shows.
Shortly after their formation the band were invited to record at Red Bull Studios in London, whilst being taken under the wing of Alternative front-runners Don Broco. Shortly after, Banshee found themselves playing at Download Festival and quickly followed by support slots with Fearless Vampire Killers and Press To Meco and leaders of the current UK rock pack Marmozets not to mention stuffing several UK tours under their belt.

The band released their debut EP, ""Say My Name” in 2015 to rave reviews from the UK's music press including spot plays by Def Leppard frontman and Planet Rock Presenter Joe Elliott. 2016 saw the band begin their productive recording relationship with the established Bruce Rintoul (also worked with Fatherson, Vukovi only to name a few) releasing the stand-alone singles ""Starts with One” followed by “You Said” which seen their most recent single released live in March 2018 to a sold out Glasgow crowd. Looking ahead, Banshee are excited to release their brand new EP ‘Bubble’ in March with more live dates than ever before in 2019.

Perfect for camping, so I did...a lot! Before mortgages and all those exciting things came along. Anyway, pre Crua Outdoors I was a consultant to the insulation industry and before that I worked as an engineering project manager. I now live in a little fishing village called Fenit, which nestles in the very south-western tip of Ireland, with my wife Julie and three kids - Tom (8 going on 48!), Cian (5) and our baby Evie! I love the outdoors and lots of sports, including Gaelic Football and Martial Arts. I also love to travel. So everything about Crua is born out of my passion to make the outdoors experience better.

"2006194742:::1964499381:::Johan Tordhag:::I have been painting since I was 14-15 years old. I paint on a regular basis, every day or so. I prefer to paint large paintings in oil and oil that I mix with acrylic so they will separate when being painted. I love to mix and experiment with colours but prefer to paint in clear colours such as blue, red as a base colour, and add some pink or red in the blue, or blue and orange in the red painting.
Mostly I paint in oil on canvas. I use different tools to apply layer of layer of paint, like a spatula or a large putty knife. I paint a lot of bulls and different faces that express some kind of emotion and integrity.
I paint for three main reasons.

1. I would like to make people happy, touched and affected with my art. I am so happy that they like it and will have them in their home. It’s a special feeling to know that your work is hanging in some ones home around the world, and they look at it every day. A positive impact on people!

2. To get peace of mind and focus on something 100%. It’s like sailing, you concentrate only on the wind and waves. In painting you give your sole and energy to just that painting (that´s why it is so difficult to sell it)
I have been an entrepreneur since I was 18 years old, always gone my own way and not follow the stream. I have been setting up and running several different companies, now at 50+ I would love to do what I always loved, paint!
The bulls for me are a symbol for power and strength, at the same time they are easy going and friendly animal, but if you mess with them they get furious. I can see myself in that kind of animal. The faces with a great expressions is also a part of me.:::1658:::333:::0.26448283858998145:::0.4938634777920492:::1:::0:::2019|||"

"988340001:::1873871093:::Ina:::Hey everyone, my name is Ina and I'm the founder of My Mantra Active. I’d need a coffee and a few hours to reel off my biography, but for the sake of this project I'll do my best to keep it short and sweet. When I was 15, my family decided to start a new life in the UK. We didn't speak English, have any friends in the UK or know much about the British way of living - I mean who puts milk in their tea? We had to start from scratch. I only took one year of English lessons and picked up the rest through reading stacks and stacks of romance novels (you got me, I’m a romantic at heart). It's safe to say I now speak English more fluently than my native Romanian.

My first few years in the UK were all about discovering who I am and what I'm supposed to be doing with my life - you know, the simple questions. I’ve always had a passion for fitness and travel, so I naturally gravitated towards that kind of lifestyle. It all started when I walked into a
kickboxing club at the ripe old age of 17. I spent the next 10 years learning about the discipline
and respect that martial arts teaches, and basically becoming a better human. And I got my Black Belt, which is kind of cool. From there, I got certified as a Personal Trainer. I started
training people in the park, and eventually in a gym (where I met Adam, co-founder of my business and all-round man of my dreams). I warned you I was a romantic.

It has been the most insane, incredible, and humbling journey ever since. Our first big move was a relocation to a small island in Thailand, where we worked at a gym, sunbathed all day and daydreamed about travelling the world. Even though we lived in Thailand, we still felt trapped. During the first few months of island living, I came up with the idea of My Mantra
Active. I launched 8 pairs of leggings 8 months later (from a hotel room in India). A lot has changed since. We soon relocated to Australia and then back in London in the space of a year.

When we arrived back in the UK, we refused to believe that our dreams of travelling were over. We searched for ideas, until one day we remembered something: when we lived on that tropical island we kept saying to ourselves, wouldn't it be cool to bring people here and keep them active, all the while exploring and having fun? A few months later that idea manifested into New Horizon Escapes.

Why am I talking about a different brand? Because I believe that My Mantra Active is the way it is because of New Horizon Escapes. It gave me the opportunity to travel the world, meet like- minded women, expand my mind and learn new things. Reach those new horizons, you know. I believe that both of my businesses are made for each other and complement one another. The logo for My Mantra Active has evolved from a delicate butterfly to a strong and empowering “MM”, evoking images of mountains and their strength. With a new lifestyle came a new style of clothing - a rebrand. Now we’re ready for the next phase, so please welcome the 2019 Summer
Collection.

P.S. thank you for the continuous support from everyone that's been there since day 1. I will
never forget how much you have all helped me. Thank you :) Are you still here? :))):::3210:::615:::0.08791284556087187:::0.35914775100630364:::1:::0:::2019|||"

When he wasn't learning the art of farming he was cooking for family and friends.

Near the end of the school he and a small group planned on flying to Paris, France for an outreach. They needed to raise $4,000+ for flights. Together they started a small breakfast restaurant on the missionary base selling French crêpes and coffee. They were able to raise well over their goal. That is where the dream of running his own crêpe business began.

"1331853379:::1730804582:::Debbie Upton:::I grew up in a fairly creative environment. Both of my parents and my brother were artistic but created art infrequently. Although I was never discouraged in creating art, my parents were pretty neutral on the subject and I never felt really supported. This is how most of my life as an “artist” has played out. I created works of art frequently and worked hard for two art-related degrees but never really took my abilities seriously, struggled with creative confidence and sometimes gave up because a piece wasn’t perfect. That closed mindset and way of being creative have changed dramatically within the past year, due to my discovery of alcohol inks. I have finally found a medium I am truly passionate about which allows me to focus on the creation of a piece of art, instead of the final product.

Alcohol inks are an acid-free, highly-pigmented, and fast drying medium to be used on non-porous surfaces. They are diluted and manipulated with isopropyl alcohol. What I love most about this medium is the way it forces me to let go of perfection. In some ways, it feels like a science experiment every time I use them. I just never know how things will turn out and that excites me! Additionally, I can leave my work alone for some time, and then pick it up to add another layer of creativity to it, never having to label it as “finished,” until the piece speaks to me as such.

I have always admired Georgia O’Keefe and how her work had such an emphasis on gradations and tones. I feel that my work accomplishes a similar effect naturally through mixing ink and alcohol, producing beautiful works with layers of color.:::1629:::295:::0.17199074074074072:::0.517361111111111:::1:::1:::2019|||"

"1953691349:::207911989:::Dennis Bethuy / aka DB Chase:::Hello, my name is DB Chase. I'm a professional musician, song writer and inventor. I grew up in Michigan in the 60s and in the 70s I moved to California. From the late 70s on through the 90s I played music for a living. Residing in Nashville Tennessee since the early 90's I am still performing and writing music to this day, I have owned and operated a number of successful businesses, including a long running nightclub am also an experienced woodworker and craftsman. My 40 years of combined time on the stage has lead to my most recent invention, The Broadway Stand. Fully patented, The Broadway Stand and I are here to change the music world and with no plans to slow down anytime soon.
When encountering the routinely small stage size's at the famous
honky tonks up and down Nashville's famous music strip, Broadway, The Broadway Stand was born. I found that by the time a number of tripod stands, pedalboards, amps and drums are combined with 4 to 5 band members crowded on to a 10'wide x 20'deep stage, performing becomes a tight proposition and stage space is a premium resource. Because of this a number of years ago I had the early ideas of The Broadway Stand. I needed something to simplify my gear setup, better utilize limited stage space, and create a piece of mutli-use, gig after gig dependable gear that i count on. Now with a lot of help from my strongly supportive community of musicians and professionals, intensive research & development, I am ready to bring The Broadway Stand to market.. Thank you for your time, my family, team of contributors and an incredible Nashville music scene in helping me get The Broadway Stand to this point. Sincerely: DB Chase:::1682:::300:::0.16730442176870747:::0.41875000000000007:::2:::1:::2014|||"
"1216606966:::582495911:::Shirts by Shurts:::Shirts by Shurts was created by me, Garrick Shurts. I started playing modern board games around 2009. I got really serious about the hobby a few years ago when my collection grew to over 200 games and I got more involved with game design. The idea for the shirts came about after a trip to GenCon in 2016. I wear polo shirts a few times a week in the office. I wanted to buy something that showed off my love of tabletop gaming that I could wear at the office. After looking through hundreds of t-shirt designs I never found a polo shirt. So I decided to create my own. After several design iterations I settled on the gaming icons on a shield concept. I have 2 successful Kickstarters under my belt and look forward to running more. Shirts by Shurts is a one man show but I have tons of support from my wife, my five kids, family and friends.:::843:::161:::0.14696969696969697:::0.2856060606060606:::3:::71:::2012|||"

"1241276222:::534262598:::Robert D. Jansen:::Dr. Robert D. Jansen trained as an experimental psychologist at the University of California-Santa Barbara, specializing in visual attention. He once gained national media attention by producing a video which lowered the blood pressure of the viewer. He taught experimental design and analysis as a professor at Palmer University in “Silicon Valley”, California until 2001. In recent years he has been producing psychoactive music and art graphics using algorithmic (e.g. fractal) techniques. He currently resides in Georgetown, Texas.

Dr Bob Jansen uses chaos mathematics as his brush and canvas. Although his technique uses fractal math and computer science there is nothing automatic or mechanical about flame fractal art creation. Actually, artists almost never invent their own instruments or tools: they merely use them well. An almost unlimited number of unique patterns called strange attractors can be extracted from chaos by non-linear iterative sampling. The task of the flame fractal artist is still the same as any painter: to decide what is beautiful or interesting. Most flame fractals are meaningless, simple, even ugly; but a few are stunning, precise yet wild, amazing beauty embedded deep within randomness. Originally developed by Scott Draves and Erik Reckase, the fractal flame algorithm is an innovative two-dimensional iterated function system that plots the output of chaotic attractors directly on an image plane. The flame algorithm includes as many as ninety-six converging non-linear functions, log-density display and structural coloring in combination with standard techniques of anti-aliasing and motion blur. These innovations maximize aesthetics by exposing more of the information content of the attractor than standard IFS’s. (A more formal mathematical description of Scott Draves’ flame algorithm is available in the web Wiki article on flame fractals.) The clarity of the final rendering depends on how many samples are accrued for each pixel during the sampling iterations. A large graphic coordinate may contain one hundred million pixels and may have required each pixel location to have been sampled one thousand times. The rendering process for such images takes hours of computer time even at two million samples per second.:::2272:::347:::0.1143671679197995:::0.3268421052631579:::25:::0:::2012|||"

"15324552:::443372847:::Jennifer Jaco:::I’m a young adult living in the Chicago suburbs with my fiance, Jeremy, and my two guinea pigs, Peanut and Tyrone. I graduated from Dartmouth College in 2013 with a degree in Psychological Brain Sciences, and spent a year after graduation working on a research project to create mentally healthy workspaces for Dartmouth’s employees. I also attended Northwestern (online, part-time) in my pursuits of an MA in Counseling, but ultimately resigned from the program, as I did not find the coursework, classroom discussion, or engagement to be effective in an online setting. Currently, I am taking courses through University of Chicago’s Booth School of Business in pursuits of my MBA, with the hopes of opening my own medical clinic that operates under the collaborative health model.

My own mental health journey has been an interesting one. As someone who suffers from depression and Seasonal Affective Disorder, with the occasional anxiety sprinkled on top, I have struggled to find an effective treatment plan for myself. My hope is that, by sharing my journey, I can help others like myself who are just doing what they can to feel happy in the world around them, while also maintaining a relatively healthy (but cynical) sense of humor.

I have a strong interest in employee wellness, mental health, benefits, hospital/clinic design, and healthcare. In my free time, I enjoy visiting zoos, attempting new craft projects, traveling (domestic and international), Netflix binging, and online shopping. My greatest passion is helping others recognize their goals, achieve their potential, and, ultimately, just feel satisfied with the great work that they do.:::1664:::270:::0.22389393939393942:::0.5668825757575757:::1:::2:::2017|||"

Fancy custom deck boxes are pretty neat and add a bit of flare to anyone's deck!

I never did care for talking about myself much, but since this is the only way you can get to know me for now, that's about it for the business side of me. I've linked all my pages so you can get a better feel for who I am as a person and the quality of work you can expect from me should you choose to back one of my projects.

On to the personal side of me. (I don't have one, I'm a mystery....if mysteries weren't mysterious)

I was born and raised down south in Mississippi. My earliest memories are of playing outside with a stick (Sword) and fighting a terrible beast (Pet hamster). We had recently moved to a piece of property that only had a well for water. No house, barn, building of any kind, we lived in a tent that first summer. We were to build our house during our first summer there. And we did! (Sort of...I mean, it was a single room with plywood floor and 3 walls, the 4th wall was just plastic stapled to the studs. But on that wall is where we had our wood burning stove/heater. (I've never been as warm in a house since, and we had 3ft of snow that first winter!) We had a 5 gallon bucket and a sheet hung up as a bathroom. But it worked, and I loved it! We had a 55 gallon drum mounted with a draining hose that had a shower head attached, so we could shower on warm days...cold days too, but I don't count that as a shower. It was more like scrub scrub scrub, fast fast fast, let me out!

As you can tell, I had an AMAZING CHILDHOOD! It was like camping all the time. Booyah!

I go my first job at the age of 8, as a gopher (Go for this, Go for that) on the construction site my grandma's husband worked at. It paid $2/day....and that was a lot for me back then. I could go to the $1 theater on Saturday, play arcades, get the LARGE popcorn/drink combo and watch movies all day long with my own money. (That's right, MY money)

I learned at a young age how to live broke, and I'm glad I did. That knowledge comes in handy whenever life tries to knock me down. I grew up proper and joined the Marines at 17. Stayed there a few years before coming home and starting my own company (Woodworking, right?....wrong!) Selling at a flea market. It was good money sometimes, bad money sometimes, but I was the boss (Of myself only, but still, it counts....right?) I worked the market and craft shows for a couple years before stumbling into a mom & pop Video store (Old school, still did VHS and only had like 7 DVDs at the time). I bought out the bin of VHS they had for sale (At a discount so I could resell them) and I left them my number in case they had more to sell later on. Business must have been bad, because not even a month later they called and asked me to offer a price on all the movies they had left. I did them one better and offered to buy the store as it sat. That store's name was Reel World. Little did I know that one decision would change my life forever. I took that store and turned it into the first DVD only store around (This was back in 1996).... It did well until not 1, but 2 large movie rental chains came to town. But, you know the drill (Improvise, Adapt, Overcome)....So, I made a switch and started carrying more games. More and more kids started hanging out at the store and eventually one of them requested I start carrying Magic the Gathering (In my mind, wth is that?) Fast forward a year and we are the only shop around running FNM and JSS events. I cut the DVD rentals down to a single shelf, the rest of the space was for couches, TVs and original Xbox systems (We had 16 and they stayed full with kids play 16 player Halo over the LAN). It was a great time to game!

{But wait, you said you've been woodworking your whole life, how'd you do that while you were doing all this other stuff?}

The answer? I never stopped, it just wasn't a business, it was a hobby I did for fun. I also picked up leathercrafting along the way, just fyi. Munchkin Metropolis is a company I originally started as a home improvement company that specialized in Children's playsets, playhouses, furniture (We did grown up things too)

Eventually I married and got talked into selling the shop.... 6 months later they had ran it into the ground and all the local kids had nowhere to go. Of course I had to reopen! They must have a place to go! Throughout the years I've had 7 renditions of Reel World Games (We added the ""Games"", but kept the name of the original shop). And just 3 years ago, I moved right back into the same building where I purchased Reel World 20 years ago. Life is funny sometimes. Now I get to do both, Reel World & Woodworking, in the same building (Different bays).

I don't make a killing, but I'm pretty happy most of the time (Except on Sunday, that's when we count the register)

Now you know my story, why not message me yours? I love listening to how other people have lived.:::5177:::1015:::0.1509833084394488:::0.4003405504501995:::21:::13:::2014|||"

"1705999559:::623924345:::Fabian Rush:::The year was 1991 and I was an eleven year old fifth grader when my parents surprised me with a Fisher Price Camcorder on Christmas morning. Little did my parents know that this gift, intended to make fun little videos with my younger brother, would lead to a successful production career in my adulthood.

The passion for making short films with my family and friends through high school and college eventually lead to my first feature production, So Mort It Be (Horror), which was rapidly picked up for world wide distribution in 2004. The movie was about a young man falling in love with a pretty young lady that he did not know was the leader of a man-killing cult. On that film I wrote, produced, directed, acted, and in so doing, learned the value of each production role. I also developed the need to work with a great team.

The experience I gained creating So Mort It Be helped me to find work on other short and feature length productions on the east coast. Then in 2010, I released my second feature film, Pantheon Black. A science fiction thriller about an ancient goddess terrorizing the crew members of a research space station. This film was shot entirely against a green screen and featured original computer generated backgrounds created by my younger brother Gavan. The ever increasing drive to make movies lead to the release of my third feature, Alien Face Bashers, in 2011. Also released as a web series, AFB was about a woman's horrifying discovery that she had frequently been abducted by aliens and experimented upon. To put an end to this ongoing intrusion, she joined a gang of other abduction victims who called themselves the Alien Face Bashers. So far, this film project has reached the furthest with a steady fan base stretching from America to the Philippines. With each new film, production value and storytelling skills have improved dramatically thanks to my team of close and passionate friends. In addition to my production career, I have enjoyed nearly a decade of wild stage show antics as the singer of industrial rock band Synthetic Nightmare.

Now, after years of experience producing independent films and rocking numerous stages with the band, the time has come to merge these two art forms into one amazing production. Fhtagn: Rock Opera of Dooom promises to be our best production yet.:::2336:::400:::0.0853570426487093:::0.427885101010101:::2:::6:::2015|||"

"1895486010:::2476795:::Prep Rally:::“I hope this doesn’t sound weird...” That was the tentative text Drew Norris had sent to Tatum Russo that started the beginnings of what is now electro-pop duo ‘Prep Rally’

After Norris had tried out for guitar in another local Denver band, that Russo was a part of, the group had disbanded. Cue text from Norris; he and Russo began writing and recording songs for all of 2016 and started playing shows in late 2017. Their music began with ethereal piano melodies from Norris that Russo began to write lyrics and craft vocal melodies off of creating some of their first singles. Norris covering keys, guitar, and production combined with Russo’s lyrics, vocals, songwriting and searing flute solos created a sound that Denver was not truly ready for, but a sound that rallied the quirkiest audience. Drawing comparisons from Grimes, CHVRCHES, and Marina and the Diamonds, Prep Rally has proven to be a niche pop in Denver! Prep Rally released their first EP ‘Passing Notes’ in early 2018 with some headbangers like “Fire Decides” and “Crazy Toms” Embracing a style of ‘Stay Weird’ the duo will keep you on your toes, and of course you can backline with their drums.:::1168:::216:::0.010416666666666666:::0.41111111111111115:::1:::0:::2019|||"

"1277114925:::1754994380:::Allan C. R. Cornelius:::I can’t remember a time when I did not create stories. Though I may not have written them down, they nonetheless played through my mind as I sat staring up at the ceiling on summer mornings before finally dragging myself out of bed. They ran through the crude and talentless pictures I drew when I should have been listening to the teacher at school. And they definitely played out in the all-out wars between the Lego or Lincoln Log fortresses I built.

Like many before me and, I’m sure, many after me, tabletop roleplaying provided my first taste of sharing stories with other people. No one else wanted to run the game, and it looked like it would be fun, so I gave it a try. And I loved it. I still didn’t write much down (I found I was pretty decent at just winging it) but I loved sharing the story in my head with my friends. I loved the look on their faces when I surprised them with something or the cheers of victory and high-fives when they overcame an obstacle. It was great fun, and something I still enjoy every time.

Fast forward to College in the late ‘90s where I decided to major in Computer Science. I liked computers and I knew you could make lots of money with them, so it seemed like a logical choice. I found a tabletop group (including my future wife) and we were having a grand old time. We’d sit in the dorm room or at the dinner table and talk for hours about what was going on in the campaign and what should happen next. By this time, I was actually planning things out and I discovered that despite being more work, it was even more fun. Which inspired me to start writing those adventures down.

I changed my major to English (there’s a lesson there about doing what you love and not what’ll make you money) and four years later I had my first book. It would take me years to realize just how bad it was. But it didn’t matter, I was hooked. Though it took several more years to get around to writing another book, I now knew what it was what I wanted to do. I determined to get myself a Masters in Creative Writing and conquer the skills I needed to realize my dream. I finished Whispers at the Altar, the first book in the Altar Tetrology in 2017 and self-published it to rave reviews. Blood at the Altar will mark my second release and I don’t plan on stopping any time soon.:::2316:::456:::0.11225845410628021:::0.4552173913043478:::2:::1:::2017|||"

"762172591:::1959750502:::Lizzy Hall:::In August 2018 The Hygiene Bank was set up to provide hygiene essentials, personal care and beauty products to those living in poverty, via food banks, women’s refuges, hostels, social services, schools and other organisations working directly with those in need.
Founder, Lizzy Hall set it up after watching anti austerity film I Daniel Blake, directed by Ken Loach. The incredibly moving film relays the brutal reality of often unseen and hidden hygiene poverty within our society. Lizzy, a widowed mother-of-two from Sevenoaks, knew all to well how personal circumstances can dramatically change and having previously taught yoga in prisons understood the importance of not judging others until you have walked in their shoes.
Galvanised to do something, Lizzy sent a plea to friends on WhatsApp asking for unused and unwanted toiletries that she would take to her local foodbank.
The response was overwhelming and her initiative grew exponentially in a few short weeks.
Now, just over 6 months on, The Hygiene Bank has already distributed nearly 16 tonnes of hygiene products, amounting to a conservative retail value in excess of £210,000. They have become a registered national charity with over 160 locations across the UK and gained a growing community of over 5000 supporters on social media.
The organisation includes 130 regular volunteers who are the backbone of the organisation, as well as an experienced trustee board, including a management consultant and ex chief exec of NHS, principal social worker for all of Kent, CEO of award-winning creative agency and a CFO of a private bank. The Hygiene Bank, along with the support of their volunteers, growing social media community and new pledges are now looking to achieve their mission to eradicate hygiene poverty in the UK with the launch of their new campaign #ITSINTHEBAG.:::1846:::298:::0.04735479797979798:::0.3005498251748252:::1:::0:::2019|||"

Blind Beggar Miniatures has now run over forty successful Kickstarter campaigns, beginning with the Blind Beggar Launch campaign, which saw the birth of the company in December 2015,
Since then the Blind Beggar has added regular releases to those initial ranges of Pulp, Old West and Cthulhu Mythos themed miniatures.

2016 saw the introduction of the 'Outlanders' sci-fi setting, a range of figures suitable for classic sci-fi gaming that also work perfectly well for the Post-Apocalypse and Steampunk genres.

2017 saw the first of the Android Collectives come off of the production line. There are now almost thirty models in the range already and more are planned.

All of these ranges will see expansion with future releases on a regular basis, with the main emphasis being the expansion of the Outlanders range, but new ranges are in the development stage.

I hope that you like at least some of them and fancy taking part in one or more future campaigns to expand the range.:::1042:::172:::0.21739847454133168:::0.4722373856302428:::53:::16:::2013|||"

SCULPTOR, PAINTER, INVENTOR LIVES AND WORKS IN PARIS, SINCE 1978. HE IS THE PROMOTER OF THEORETICAL ART.

Introducing Theoretical Art

According to Leonardo da Vinci, art must be based on a theoretical knowledge of nature. That is also the case for me, but it is essential to remember that theoretical and mathematical values are perishable.

My «theoretical art» concentrates on the aesthetics of theory and on its artistic potential.

Building a personal creative universe is essential to the authenticity of works of art.

In 1977, it became clear to me that having a vision based on the three existing dimensions and the singular dimension of time would prevent me from developing a truly new and original work.

To tie the world of general relativity to the quantum universe, physics theories add new dimensions to the four existing dimensions in order to open new horizons.

In search of new artistic matter, I adopted the opposite method, that of reducing the number of dimensions.

The industrial process Folding Volume 2D proposed in February 2012 as well as the Volume 2D patent obtained 10 years ago exist as theoretical art that, in addition to their originality and novelty essential to their patentability, are based on the idea that a geometric space with memory, with parameters that differ from the metric nature of objects in the printing world, is the ideal universe for experimentation. The image reproduced on a stack of sheets appears projected trapped in the mass of paper.

One can imagine in reference to this spatial volume that each of the parallel levels memorizes the whole of the volumetric and chromatic values that pass through it and that the intervals between these images from one level to another contain a space-time value that reveals the direction of the movement.

In the hopes of going back to the origins of these forms and volumes, the mathematical memory of this mass provides for experimental manipulations that, through spatial fractures, projects the original object into another space, that of a parallel reality.

This medium, provided by the printing industry, once intelligently folded or sliced, allows for the image and original forms to reappear in refractions, reflections and volumetric anamorphoses. The works resulting from this process help spectators become accustomed to a new mathematic vision.

- My creative universe contains two spatial dimensions and one space-time dimension.

- My artistic act is a fracture of that space-time, the opening of a escape hatch from our current reality.

- My work’s medium is mathematical memory.:::2838:::454:::0.12683678894205208:::0.3860154173312068:::1:::0:::2019|||"
"1258942964:::1957162629:::Daniel Hjarten:::I was born in Varberg, Sweden 30 years ago. I felt a great interest in sports from an early age and I started practicing combat sports really young. I took sports as a professional career and at on point in my life I was practicing Thai Box and Kickboxing as a professional athlete. Soon enough I became a high competition athlete. Unfortunately, I got injured a few years ago and as a result of that, I had to quit competing at a high level. Eventually I became a teacher and a personal trainer to many sports practitioner and athletes. After many years as an athlete, dealing with all sorts of demands and real life experiences the sports world confronts you with, I decided it was time for me to create an innovative, out of the box and stylish line of sportswear. Standards of quality, functionality and physical and mental health have the intention of developing people’s self esteem and ultimately generate the best personal results ever.:::944:::168:::0.14854166666666666:::0.3923214285714286:::1:::0:::2018|||"

I was born in canada and have lived here my entire life.
I adore all things anime and really wanted to find a way to bring my love of anime and crafty personality to life.

When i entered my early 20's I met some people that changed my views, I stopped believing i couldn't do something just because it seemed a little to far out of my reach or just an inch to far past my abilities.

I continue to try to learn and create something new everyday.

I hope we can all bring this art to life together.

We love to have our morning take away coffees, as well as our water to stay healthy and hydrated. However, we quickly became aware of the impact single use plastic was having on the environment, and soon realised we were contributing to this in the form of our daily take away coffee's and unnecessary water bottles. So, we made the decision to start reducing single-use plastic from our lives and take away coffee cups and water bottles seemed a good starting point. As a result, this meant we were carrying two bottles; one for our water and one for our take away coffee. This became inconvenient, awkward and heavy, not to mention double the risk of leakage! So, we create DUO. We believe this is a sustainable and practical bottle that will bring a whole new meaning of convenience to your life. Thanks for taking the time to read this and we hope you like our campaign. All the best, Ed and Sarah.:::1009:::185:::0.20754689754689756:::0.31876082251082255:::1:::0:::2019|||"

"150522358:::2088445524:::dan smith:::So you want to know a little somethin’ about Dan Smith aka SMIF, huh?


Usually you have to become a member of the SMIF KIDS OF AMERICA CLUB, ($5.95 in most states) but since I like you, you get the FREE tour!

First let’s start with my moniker SMIF. My Name is Dan Smith (look it up online, you’ll see that we're all there, but I am the ONE, TRUE and ONLY DAN SMITH) and with a name like that, it’s hard to know if you’ve found the real deal. You know it’s the REAL DEAL DAN SMITH because I affect a Cockney accent when writing my last name and voila’–SMIF!

I am an illustrator, card game designer, graphic designer, storyboard artist, comic book creator and cad about town. (Maybe about YOUR town!)

What have I done, you ask? Well, such fancy “TOP DRAWER” Clientele ( here comes the “list”) such as: YAHOO, LIP SERVICE, ANHEUSER-BUSCH, WALMART, SPINMASTER, HASBRO, FOX INTERACTIVE/VIVENDI UNIVERSAL, SABAN ENTERTAINMENT, THQ/MASS MEDIA, MADONNA (YES, THAT ONE–FOR THE HARD CANDY TOUR), PACIFIC PLAY TENTS, STEVE JACKSON GAMES, WHITE WOLF GAMES, BOMP RECORDS…and many more. I have also produced my own card games and I was nominated for big time awards (ORIGINS AWARDS, THE ACADEMY AWARDS FOR GAMING, people!!) for BATTLE OF THE BANDS, THE ROCK AND ROLL CARD GAME and I also a part of winning the award for best art design for the IN NOMINE roleplaying game from SJG.

People all over the world have enjoyed SMIF! (Some have even told me so.)

Little known SMIF fact #17: I know almost everything not worth knowing. Trivia master for my age range. I have no idea what knucklehead band is topping the charts today... that's your problem.

What types of things “turn me on” artistically? Alright, alright, since I asked…Pin up art, comic art, advertising art, art art, Art Fleming, the list is just too large! Pop culture a go go!!

Little known SMIF fact #28: I have a collection of 110 (that is not a typo) different versions of the theme to Peter Gunn. (Sorry if you couldn’t find any copies, I didn’t mean any harm.) And if you haven't seen the tv show, every episode is like a mini movie, it's so good.

Side collections include to “Cast your fate to the wind”, ""Mr. Lucky"" and “Jesus Christ Superstar”. (Oh the JCS collection is boss!!!)

I have Kickstarted successfully the KING of CRIME card game, BATTLE OF THE BANDS card game, FIVE MINUTE FIGHT:MONSTER card game, and am the kingpin behind the DUNGEON COMMUNITY SERIES of OSR book(s)... so I have had experience with this sort of thing. (If you are interested in those games, let me know. I have a couple left. And I do mean only a couple, they sold out, fast...)

I currently/always live in Los Angeles California, the center of the universe. Don't hate, you'll be here eventually. And in my lane! HONK HONK!!!!!!:::2798:::527:::0.048950301001082254:::0.3381612723214286:::9:::271:::2012|||"

"1536392834:::893626427:::Bryan Spencer:::My name is Bryan Spencer, and I am a retired Navy veteran. I picked up film writing at the halfway point of my military career. In 2012 I came up with the epic concept idea of Relics of Jericho, which gives a compelling story of the war between Heaven and Hell spilling out into the open of modern day life. So the question is why now after all this time do I now come forward with this exciting concept? The answer is simply dedication, I had a goal to complete my 20 years of military service which shows all that I finish what I start when it comes to goals. The only issue is funds are not what they once were on active duty. This has been my passion for many years now, and I have invested a great deal of my fund into getting this project to where it is now. I have already secured trademark and copyrights with full presentation package for this concept.

We have been together almost 5 years now and are recently engaged (he's one lucky guy)! One of the first things we learned we had in common was our love for wine. This is where it all began. We decided to learn how to make wine and since then have attended two different wine schools, Gino's School of Wine and the Cherry Hill Wine Room. Attending these classes and being a part of what goes into making wine definitely peaked our interests even more. I will be attending the Wine School of Philadelphia starting in May to start the road in becoming a Sommelier (so I can drop some knowledge for y'all)! We’re extremely excited to bring the passion and love we have for wine to a beautiful space for people to learn and enjoy our favorite wines.

SO many years spent nursing babies, changing diapers and training children took a little bit of a mental toll on me. after praying for a way use my creativity, help other women and contribute financially to our family, God gave me a vision... to host an extravagant craft weekend for women! to not just teach them to find their inner artist, but to encourage them to never lose who they are. i mean, lets be honest... it's easy for us to lose ourselves in the beautiful mess of life, right?

and then it happened...

with a few girlfriends around my table, prepping gifts for craft weekend, i made my first necklace. soon came a request for necklaces with words and from there it all seems like a crazy-fun whirlwind. from making necklaces at my kitchen table to a new she-shed studio in my backyard, i would have NEVER imagined that God would do what He's done to grow this business i basically 'stumbled upon.' 10 craft weekends, 2 employees and thousands upon thousands of necklaces later, here we are!

after traveling to (and falling in love with) Cambodia in 2017, learning SO much about the complex tragedy of human trafficking, and feeling like there was WAY more i could be doing here in the States, God expanded my vision. upon returning home, i began working toward the goal of growing my company to also employ survivors of trafficking and women at risk. i envisioned a company of people who truly love, care-for and support one another, in an environment of hope! the potential to provide dignified work is limitless! i cannot wait to see what this coming year holds as i continue to work toward this audacious goal! #mycuprunnethover:::2127:::372:::0.09942168460397627:::0.2693872254288921:::1:::1:::2018|||"

"1263350680:::304725504:::Jacaranda Music:::Jacaranda Music produces a series of classical music adventures designed to awaken curiosity and discovery. Based in Santa Monica since 2003, Jacaranda was immediately hailed by the LA Weekly as “the right music in the right place at the right time.” More than a decade later, LA Weekly named Jacaranda Best Contemporary Classical Series in 2016: “Wonderfully un-stodgy curation by Jacaranda founders Patrick Scott and Mark Alan Hilt and performances by acclaimed and expert musicians make for ear-cleansing dives into bracingly new music composed largely by living composers, as well as unplayed-to-death music of the past century.”

The series is devoted to stimulating listeners with ingenious musical experiences. Alex Ross’s blog The Rest Is Noise wrote “season after season the twentieth century comes to life in Jacaranda’s programs.” Jacaranda also champions music written since 2000, as well as neglected earlier music with strong potential interest for today’s listeners. The “powerful” U.S. premiere of a co-commission with Britain’s Aldeburgh Festival, led by composer Peter Eötvös, was also cited by the LA Times for its “national significance.” These concerts are dedicated to advancing the repertoire of soloists and diverse ensembles through live music, recordings, and education.

Jacaranda recently launched METRO (Music Education Through Resource Opportunities) to network and mobilize university music students from CalArts, Chapman University, CSUN, UCLA, and USC through recorded music services, Facebook, and live concerts. Maintaining high performance standards in acoustically effective locations throughout Greater Los Angeles, this innovative concert series is committed to increasing understanding of classical music using unexpected strategies – and by telling the stories of its makers with passion. “A sell-out throng of glitter, beauty and brains in all sorts and varieties responded warmly to the totally decadent music menu…full of energy and themes of unimaginable beauty…” said the Huffington Post.:::2038:::316:::0.1907731837323674:::0.5131545778484554:::1:::0:::2019|||"

"22766821:::1720355849:::Rachael Carnes:::I wrote my short play Partner Of — last year, after grappling with the word “relationship” in a call for scripts on “the relationship between Thomas Jefferson and Sally Hemings.” Denise O’Neal, founder of Houston's Fade to Black Festival, generously consulted on my first draft. Since the three characters in this play are African American, and I am not, that seemed the only possible way to approach this project critically or appropriately. The ten-minute Partner Of — has had three staged readings across the United States: At Mainstage West in Sebastopol, CA, on the steps of the Historic Mordecai House in Raleigh, NC, as part of the MOJOAA Performance Group’s Reclamation and as a finalist in the 2018 Midwest Dramatists Center Conference in Kansas City. The play has been published by The Coachella Review. It has also been chosen for workshop, from among 150 scripts, by the Ivoryton Playhouse, in Ivoryton, CT, and will received full productions at Rover Dramawerks in Plano, TX, and Between Us Productions, in NYC, where it won Best Play. ""Partner Of—"" has been selected from more than 900 scripts, for inclusion in the 2019 Samuel French Off-Off Broadway Festival, August 19-24, in New York City. It is a tremendous honor to be invited as one of 3% of playwrights whose work will be shown. And among those 30 writers, the six finalists in the festival will have their work published by Samuel French. A stunning possibility. My background as a journalist is in historical research, and to engage with this narrative, I consulted with Niya Bates, Public Historian of Slavery and the African American Experience at Monticello, who offered her invaluably insightful dramaturgical guidance. ""Partner Of —"" serves to reframe the life of Sarah ""Sally"" Hemings, enslaved by Thomas Jefferson. Hemings bore six of Jefferson's children, while in captivity, her first pregnancy at just 14. Set in the confines of Hemings' windowless cell underneath Monticello, this play lifts three voices we've not heard from much, as Sally, her mother and grandmother confront their trauma, their fears and expectations, and imagine the possibilities of an illusory future.

"758357666:::2054409312:::Eric Renshaw:::I grew up in Mid-Michigan. I am also rather reclusive, preferring peace and solitude I only find in the deep woods or open waters. I have hunted and fished my entire life, and love a good adventure which usually has some slight risk to life and limb. I have a fascination with electricity for some strange reason and an aptitude for understanding it. I love making things, from scratch and especially from wood, the old fashion way, yet enjoy my tech gadgets and power tools for making an idea quickly and efficiently. I am an avid reader, consuming 2-3 books weekly (some are borderline self improvement), science fiction, and fantasy novels.

I have run my own business building and restoring wood boats for 28 years, 6 of which I suffered through working as a heavy truck mechanic at the same time. Spent 3 years at U of M studying biology, chemistry, and physics but lost my financial aid and couldn't finish my degree there. I am currently working on a degree in Naval Architecture and Marine Engineering through a home study course.

It encompasses an indigenous culture of the men and women who toiled in the cotton fields. I want my art to tell the story of a life hard-lived, of the day-to-day existence of African American people. The art invites us to celebrate survivors who prevailed, despite incredible odds. The art remembers the people, the art cherishes the people, and the art pays homage to all that they were and all that we have become as a race, as a people. I began creating acrylic and mixed media paintings over 10 years ago, and viewed the work as a personal way to both embrace and celebrate the life of my family tree.:::701:::128:::0.13095238095238096:::0.2130952380952381:::1:::0:::2019|||"

My creative works also revive old world lore and the vibes of Victorian times.

Since I first held a camera in my hands as a child, I’ve had an unwavering affinity for capturing the countless beauties that lay dormant amongst the shadows; the places where my friends and most other people would dare not look. During high school, I would spend a bulk of my days neck-deep in the realm of noir and dark comedic entertainment. Two decades later, my love of photography and all things gloom has only grown, and my sights are set on becoming a full-time fine art and model photographer.

She spent her time starting an agency, Minnesota CarePartner, that made therapy and mental health services more accessible to people with barriers to quality and affordable care. Over time, the work became triggering for her and reminded her of her own cultural and familial losses when she was taken from her birthmother and then her foster mother. She became increasingly stressed and traumatized by the work and coped with numbing out. After risking the things that were important to her the most, she dove into recovery and decided to incorporate the addiction world into her meaningful work. She realized that isolation and secrecy kept her sick. She wants to create a space, a community, and an opening for others inflicted with the disease so they, too, can reach their highest potential. Hence, the idea for Coffee Rehab was born.

"854937082:::672069369:::Zenon Zadravec:::Zen Zadravec, Jazz pianist, is a musical chameleon. Whether it is Jazz, R&B, Funk, Rock, or Pop, he plays each with a freshness and confidence rarely found in someone so young. Born in Winnipeg, Canada in 1974, Zadravec studied classical piano from the age of five. At eleven he began the saxophone and the flute. Hearing Miles Davis transformed his life, and influenced his decision to become a Jazz musician. In 1992, Zadravec attended York University's Jazz Program (Toronto, Canada), and in 1997 he graduated with a Bachelors in Fine Arts. During his time at York, he was also the recipient of two Oscar Peterson Awards for excellence as a Jazz pianist. In 2000, he earned a Masters Degree in Jazz Performance at Rutgers University. Zadravec also has studied with some of the biggest names in Jazz such as: Kenny Barron, Don Thompson, John Gittens, Vic Juris, Ted Dunbar, and Ralph Bowen. Versatile, creative, energetic, and dynamic, Zen is constantly experimenting and refining his sound and musical conception through concerts, recordings and education. A natural innovator and leader, he runs two of his own bands: the Zen Zadravec Quartet (straight ahead Jazz), and Human Revolution (Jazz Fusion). Zadravec is also very much in demand as a side man in straight ahead Jazz, Fusion, and Funk and has performed or recorded with: Kenny Davis, Steve Turre, Onaje-Allan Gumbs, Ralph Bowen, Derrick Gardner, Sean Jones, Conrad Herwig, Eliot Zigmund, Phoenix Rivera, Freddie Hendrix, Don Thompson, Barry Elmes, Mike Murley, Lorne Lofsky, Charles Fambrough, Valery Ponomarev, Dave Watson, Darryl Dixon, Darlene Love, Sally Kellerman, Connie Francis, Bob Newhart, Gloria Gaynor, Joan Rivers among others. Zen has performed on the WHOOPI GOLDBERG radio show on WKTU in New York, THE TODAY SHOW with GLORIA GAYNOR on NBC with Kathie-Lee Gifford hosting, the Wendy Williams Show with dancer Maxim Smerkovskiy of DANCING WITH THE STARS on FOX 5 New York, and has released a debut CD with his quartet entitled “COMING OF AGE”.
With this release, the Zen Zadravec Quartet has been turning heads and exciting audiences in the Jazz world.

Kenny Barron, Jazz Pianist (NEW YORK, USA) writes: “Mr. Zadravec is not only a first rate pianist, but also a first rate composer, and arranger with a wide creative palette. His playing is muscular and filled with a sense of adventure. His writing is full of interesting harmonic surprises and textures. I believe this first recording by Zen Zadravec says that there will be many more recordings with even more surprises!!!”

~Don Thompson, Jazz Pianist, Bassist, and Vibraphonist (TORONTO, CANADA) writes:

""This is some very interesting and exciting music played by a group of great musicians. Zen is clearly a serious talent!!!""

~Edward Blanco, All About Jazz (MIAMI, USA) writes: “Once in a while you come across a young, new artist who presents an exciting new sound that few words one can say about the music seem inadequate. Such is the case with Canadian-born pianist Zen Zadravec, his quartet and this first effort. There's no question that Zen Zadravec comes of age on this impressive and compelling debut. The music you will encounter on Coming of Age reveals the remarkable talents of an artist whose performance and compositions have forged a gem of an album!”


Along with his Jazz quartet, and his Fusion group “Human Revolution”, Zen has showed versatility by performing with a multitude of Jazz Artists, Vocalists, Comedians, and Dancers. Along with creating scores for Television and Film, Zadravec continues to pursue the path of the performer, the composer, sideman, and the ARTIST. Zadravec’s Jazz groups also pursue a busy concert schedule with dates in the United States, Canada, Europe, India, and Japan.:::3771:::624:::0.18155688832772163:::0.4047138047138048:::1:::0:::2013|||"

Since our first release (Hexapod Defense Force) a few years ago, we have continued to produce quality games. Collider was greenlit on steam and has been featured in many bundles. As the Openwest 2016 conference approached, we turned our attention towards Wet Blanket. We assembled and ordered our first test deck and brought it to the conference where we received great feedback and praise for making an excellent family friendly card game.

Our team members come from a variety of backgrounds. Joseph's focus is on network and data integrity. Braxton does a lot of our development and is considered our heavy math expert. Stephen is our art director, making everything look and sound just right and finally Brian has joined the team, bringing some new art styles and ideas. Despite being a small group, we have been able to consistently produce quality games that are well received.

We also enjoy working with communities and have sponsored the Openwest conference. This has come in the form of monetary sponsorship as well as teaching classes. We believe that there is more to making a great game than sales. People should be brought together, and our games are one of the ways that we do that.:::1271:::216:::0.14837043908472478:::0.34184987631416197:::2:::1:::2016|||"

Whether that’s the sleep deprived days, the squishy newborn snuggles, the glorious giggles and the seemingly ordinary moments that you will one day cherish – each and every moment is a magical milestone that deserves to be treasured and remembered.

We also believe that every baby is so beautifully unique and special and so are the memories you make together. That’s why we’re working hard to create a range of baby journals that are just as unique and special as your tiny bundle of joy. Every journey into parenthood is different, and the way we record it should be too.

Our journals can be as generic or as personal as you wish. Whether you just want to put your little one’s name on the front, or handpick the pages you want to see inside… That’s what we’re here for. We want to give you the most beautiful tools we can to record these magical moments in a way that you and your child can treasure forever. We’re creating more than just products, we’re creating family treasures.:::1074:::205:::0.21870370370370373:::0.5312962962962963:::1:::0:::2019|||"

"2000764655:::720355929:::Blato Zlato:::Blato Zlato (""Swamp Gold"" in Bulgarian) is a New Orleans-based Balkan band featuring dreamy three-part vocal harmonies and hard-hitting instrumentals. Blato Zlato was founded in 2015 in New Orleans as a result of a super-group collaboration between the instrumental Eastern European and Klezmer band G-String Orchestra and a cappella Balkan vocal trio Pyeya. First formed to play NYC's Golden Festival in 2015, members realized the potential that could be had from full three-part harmony vocals over violin, accordion, bass and percussion, and so they continued and expanded membership. Their 2017 debut album, Swamp Gold, is the result of collaborative improvisations and arrangements from all six members, fueled by late-night rakia and wine and informed by a love for the various elements of Balkan music that drew them to it: the taksim, the drone, the close vocal harmonies, and the driving irregular meters.

Blato Zlato's members each come to the band from vastly different backgrounds. Drummer Boyanna Trayanova is originally Bulgarian and immigrated to the United States as a child, growing up studying percussion with musical masters in New Orleans and then rediscovering her roots through the tupan and doumbek as an adult. Other members are American with roots to Europe, with vocalist Annalisa Kelly having grown up in the USSR, Yugoslavia, Turkey, and other European countries, and accordionist/vocalist Lou Carrig growing up a dual citizen of both the United States and Ireland, splitting time between both countries. All members have devoted years to studying Balkan musical tradition in the United States, Bulgaria, Turkey, Serbia, and Greece, and are proud to share membership with other Balkan bands as part of a blossoming Balkan music scene in New Orleans.:::1780:::279:::0.11221590909090909:::0.42868844696969693:::2:::0:::2017|||"

"730133585:::169576321:::Kenneth Jones:::Fishing Tournament Solutions is the result of over 10 years’ experience supporting The Babes on the Bay fishing tournament in Rockport, TX. Babes on the Bay is an all-women’s fishing tournament that has been in existence since the year 2000. The tournament is hosted and run by the CCA Texas Aransas Bay Chapter, based in Rockport, Texas. The tournament was created to help educate women about the sport of saltwater fishing in a conservation minded approach. In 2018 over 1,100 lady anglers entered the tournament. and a revenue draw of over $100,000.00. $35.00 of each registration went to the CCA Texas Aransas Bay Chapter.
In 2007 we developed the Leader Board for the tournament. The tournament rules are very complicated, Boat/Team based registration with 5 divisions and two fish species. In 2016 I was asked to develop an online registration system. The Boat/Teams register the members and pay their fees to PayPal. Also, many reports are necessary to manage the day of the event. Boat/ Team report, Weigh-in sheets, Bag Tags and more.

This experience led us to thinking that Fishing Tournament automation is a service that we could provide. So, we developed Fishing Tournament Solutions Fishing tournament software. This software provides the complete solution for new or existing fishing tournaments.

My professional focus is in the development and illustration of tarot and oracle decks, but I also do a fair amount of commission work, really anything from album art work, to portraits, to logo design.

Each deck I illustrate takes between one and two years of work to complete. My Hardy Tarot deck was the first to be released in 2015. The Hardy Tarot has been released in four versions, the original HT (currently out of print), the large HT (printed once a year in very small limited runs around the holidays), the full bleed HT (a best selling open edition deck), and the borderless HT (an out of print special edition variation of the deck.) After that was the Forces Flora + Fauna Oracle deck, released in 2017 after a year and a half of painstaking illustration. I am currently working on two decks and an in depth companion guide to the Forces Flora + Fauna Oracle. I hope to be releasing my Enchanted Woods Lenormand deck in the spring, it is a beautiful pen and ink illustrated 36 card Lenormand deck with a charming vintage storybook vibe. I am planning on making this deck available for pre-order between January and February of 2019.

The playing card projects, Midgard, Ragnarok and Helheim, all of norse mythology have shown us the huge interest in this particular theme. This time after many hours of researching this new playing card project came to life and took its shape on the basis of numerous ideas of representing the Crusades. Many hours of designing went ahead of this project planning also calculating and communicating with our cooperators abroad.

It has been truly inspiring once again to get together for mutual creative sparring across our various every day jobs and living places - and as we've said before this is only the beginning of our journey! With the interest and support we've seen up until now our confindence has been further consolidated.

The different roles allocate themselves as always and as usual to everybodys satisfaction. - Marianne as headmanager and also creative supervisor. She sees to keep track of everything and overviewing the different processes. She has 10+ year of experience in retail and management ie. from running her own business. - Nicolai, lead artist, and as always showing his great talent for drawing by hand and in this case put legs to all the gods, goddesses and deities - to ensure their walking capabilities as well as put strenght into creating these silver prints to be as close to reality back then as possible.

- Svend, Patrick and not least the latest member Christian as designers and researchers with their unique attention to details. Always ready with quite the best input to this new project of ours. Everybody wents 'all-in' to bring authenticity, rarity and uniqueness showcasing the Crusades at its best.

"1584349524:::1002591127:::EMMYDEVEAUX:::EMMYDEVEAUX launched her label in February 2018 after leaving her position with the University of Alberta as the Executive Director of the School of Retailing. Her long work hours and lifestyle meant busy days with usually multiple outfit changes. She set out to develop a high quality, comfortable, yet contemporary clothing label for busy women on the go. The Body Collection was born, focusing on one particular fabric with every piece featuring two layers. This allows women to feel comfortable and covered but still accentuate their curves.

Emily got her start in the retail industry when she was designing clothes at 15 years old but instead pursued the business of retail by starting a small consulting business. She felt she didn't understand enough about the business side to be a successful fashion designer.

Her client list quickly grew until she was working with multi-national retailers and prominent shopping centres.

Cut to 14 years later when she took on a role with the University. She wanted to launch her clothing company by the age of 35 and she did it! Her goal is to make women feel great and encourage them to think positively about themselves. Emily is a size 16 yet everyone constantly comments on her confidence, she believes a Confident Woman is a Powerful Woman....and a lot of the time that confidence starts in the closet.

Emily is also passionate about reducing the amount of clothing waste in landfills. Therefore she wanted to make a brand that didn't pay attention to industry trends or seasons. Our pieces can be layered but also worn in the summer. There will always be slight changes, however, the same black dress we carry now will be the same one next year. We are aiming to have little to no inventory waste.

In order to accomplish this, she had to ensure the brand could be accessible to customers all over the world.:::1873:::321:::0.12786405723905722:::0.33981200897867564:::2:::0:::2018|||"

"1311807355:::1126924121:::Gretchen Rhodes Music:::American singer/songwriter Gretchen Rhodes has long been a fan favorite – and it’s easy to see why. Rhodes’ unique, soulful blend of blues and rock always gets audiences on their feet, singing, dancing and joining in the fun. While trained in the classical tradition, Rhodes has found her passion fronting rock and blues bands.

Playing in front of a live audience is what I live for. The transference of energy is incredible…and to be able to express my Soul and touch the souls of others is unlike anything I can describe. It’s a palpable rush… Rhodes has collaborated on stage with an impressive list of music industry heavies, including funk genius George Clinton, rock icon Steven Tyler and Doobie Brother Pat Simmons, as well as recording, performance, and music video appearances with Kenny Chesney in his ‘Life on a Rock’ album and ‘Wild Child’ music video.

Always looking for directions to grow musically, Gretchen has a side electronica project with the Embassy of Joy. Embassy of Joy produced the track “Addiction” (a remake of Jane’s Addiction’s “Jane Says”) which was the #1 Deep House track in the world for three months.

I love making music because, aside from my family, music is my Life. It always has been. It is the most basic expression of myself and if I weren’t able to do so a huge part of my life force would fade away. Currently, Rhodes is touring with Rock N’ Roll Hall of Famer and founding member of Traffic, Dave Mason along with the founder of ‘the Blues Brothers’ and Rolling Stone’s 39th greatest guitar player of all time, Steve Cropper. When not touring, Rhodes fronts Mick Fleetwood’s Band with the legendary Fleetwood Mac drummer.

Kenny Chesney ""The thing about Gretchen is that she had this voice that you could hear in a room. When she’d sing, people would turn around to see who it was… and she could keep folks there all night, just listening to her songs. I know: my friends and I used to go down to this beach bar a lot and listen to her play… to sit on a stool and play music because you love it, because you have songs to sing, that’s the mark of a music person. Gretchen has always had that! She is as good as they come, has a voice that’ll stop you – and no matter what happens, she’s going to be making music, because that’s who she is"":::2294:::447:::0.31019921436588105:::0.39992283950617286:::1:::1:::2019|||"

"1421716661:::888752941:::Thornwillow:::In 1985 Thornwillow Press was founded by Luke Ives Pontifell who spent his summer vacations from Harvard College printing and hand-binding books. What started as a labor of love has grown into one of the leading purveyors of fine books and custom stationery in the world, consolidating centuries of craft and technique in a complex of historic buildings in Newburgh, New York.

In subscribing to a Thornwillow publication, you not only add a beautiful and important volume to your library… you support the 20 designers, printers, and binders who have dedicated themselves to these arts.

Since its founding, the Press has published over 80 editions. We have been proud to publish original work by some of the world’s leading writers, poets, artists, political leaders, scholars, historians, and journalists — from William L. Shirer to Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr., from Walter Cronkite to Chief Justice Warren Burger, from James Merrill to Mark Strand, from Helmut Kohl to Barack Obama, from John Updike to Henry Louis Gates, Jr.

In 2015, the Thornwillow Institute was founded to promote and perpetuate the art of craftsmanship in all its forms, especially related to the written word. We believe that how we communicate and preserve ideas matters. Objects you can touch, keep, and give are central to the identity of our culture. These objects become the legacy of our society. They memorialize our values, triumphs, challenges, and dreams. The Thornwillow Institute is dedicated to passing down the arts and crafts of the written word which, increasingly, are endangered. We do this through partnerships with institutions and fellowships with individual artists, students, and makers.

The Thornwillow Makers Village in Newburgh, New York, is our campus. It is a complex of historic buildings with the press at its center and around which we are developing work studios, affordable housing, a gallery and event space, a market place, class rooms, a recording and video studio, and a community bookstore and cafe.

The Village supports programming from fellowships, internships, residencies, workshops, and jobs training to publications, concerts, performances, lectures, screenings and exhibitions. The Makers Village is a place to host programming and events that bring craft and culture to the community and is a platform from which to launch what gets created here to the world at large.

"186085636:::1951262180:::Brian Dunn:::Brian is a creative that dug into his creativity at a very young age. Influence by the monsters in the movies and the masks that would hang in Halloween shops. The strange and beautiful from nature, these were the images that stuck in his mind and fueled his passion. Drawing from his favorite images in magazines or movie covers he would create his own artwork to put on his walls. He would create his own characters once in a while but would focus on the creatures he loved from the movies and learning the techniques from others. As he grew older and seeing his favorite images being made over and over again by the world he started shifting towards giving birth to his own monsters and trying to create the characters that would make an impact like those from the old films. These would be characters and creatures that would stand out in a person’s mind and last a lifetime. This continued until college where he got his degree in animation, creating new characters and making them move. This is where he first started sculpting and making stop motion puppets. The sculpting phase struck a new chord and spawned a new hobby for him. It wasn’t so much about the animation of the character but bringing a new one to life, a new beast that the world has never seen. Learning the process he started to pursue new passions after college. He started by making the masks he collected as a child and wanted to fill his walls with the monsters he made alongside his favorite monsters. 3 years later he was working 2 jobs along with trying to pursue his career in art. He was at a life changing moment when he looked at his art and didn’t feel anything. “I was looking at my characters and I felt nothing. They weren’t speaking out to me and they weren’t interesting to me. This is when I told myself I need to step up my game.” After this is quit 1 of his jobs and poured everything he had into his passion. He took a character that he loved and gave it a soul. He put his heart into this piece and it was immediately recognized by collectors. The feedback and attention he received from this piece was an eye opener as well as a motivator to keep moving forward and to pour my emotions into each piece he created. This is when he made the decision and started to develop his brand. Since then he has continued to learn and grow as an artist. He expanded his works and abilities from masks into resin busts, model kits, and portraits as well as upped his performance in painting. He learned on his own from watching other artists, demonstration videos, studying anatomy and facial structure, as well as studying life and the emotions and characters around us both human and nature. All of his past experiences led him towards making monsters and characters he enjoyed from his childhood. Now he is excited to give birth to his own creations that he can share with viewers from around the world. Unleashing his creativity for the world to experience and be inspired.:::2961:::551:::0.1823065476190476:::0.37215773809523806:::5:::33:::2013|||"

"502896414:::1784320521:::David Tillery:::Hi, I'm David Tillery from Tampa Florida. I'm an entrepreneur & inventor & president of a non profit steel tip dart league and I've recently coached youths for British steel tip darts competition. One of which, went to the Youth Nationals two years in a row..
While raising my nephew, I became part of the board gaming community, studying game mechanics and tapping into my inner geek for over a decade. I especially enjoy British steel tip darts for it's tradition of good sportsmanship and courteous etiquette towards your opponents/s, before, during and after the match. I have spent over 15 years in sales and marketing and was the global sales leader for the world's largest independent stocking distributors of electronic components managing a 2 1/2 million dollar account. I love sales, but fell out of love for the company. I took time to manage my own business running my own mall kiosk with a brand new product line and broke sales records for the Mighty Dwarf Speaker company. I have a certification from the University Of South Florida as a Meeting & Events planner. I've spent many years as an emcee, performer and public speaker which I like to use to create networks of friends, associates and long lasting contacts. I look toward organizing tournaments to promote the game nationally. As a league president and a member of the 2016 Caribbean Cup team representing the United States & member of several State teams, I have learned many dart games over the years and studied the mechanics and rules that make them special. The game I have invented offers a challenge for all levels of play and is in itself an excellent way to practice your skill as a player. There really is no other game similar to this one. It seems like it was meant for me to create this game. In a way, this game is a reflection of who I am.:::1829:::326:::0.03139407467532468:::0.32504870129870134:::2:::0:::2017|||"

"83308720:::1107655323:::Mike Brunacini:::For Mike Brunacini, or Bruno, music has always been a passion. As a toddler, his favorite movie was Disney’s Fantasia. This early bud of interest eventually blossomed into a full-fledged dream of becoming a songwriter by the time he reached middle school. Despite never having any formal music training, Bruno began playing piano and guitar. It was a long road, but his musical talent eventually caught up with his creative ambition and with that, his original music got better and better. In the years following high school, Bruno decided to finally put an album together. It took a lot longer than anticipated, but “Allen Park” was eventually released on December 21, 2012. It was not a perfect record, but its recording process was filled with lessons that would shape his later releases. In fact, he later remixed the album and released it as “Return to Allen Park” in February 2018. This new mix of the album fixed a lot of the problems that plagued the original.

After 2012’s original “Allen Park” release, Mike Brunacini went straight to work, recording and releasing the “Laceless EP” and a second album, 2014’s concept-driven “Artificial Individual.” This sophomore release was more refined in its writing and production than Allen Park. It was a big step forward in a short amount of time.
In 2015, Bruno moved from Western New York to North Carolina, where he released his second EP, “Holding On.” Again, this release marked a milestone in production, writing, and performance. Interesting to note that this EP was entirely self-produced. Every track was performed, recorded, and mixed by Mike for the first time.

During his time in North Carolina, Mike Brunacini was busy writing and recording his third album, “Cherry Springs.” After moving back to his hometown of Jamestown, NY, Bruno had it mixed and mastered at Watchmen Studios. It isn’t so much a departure from his previous style as much as it is an improvement and honing of the craft. The songs on this album were not arranged as a concept as they were on Allen Park and AI. Each song on this album tells a unique story and that makes the entire project more approachable, not to mention that the songs were poppier than ever! “Cherry Springs” was released in November 2016 after a successful Kickstarter campaign helped to fund the physical production of CDs and distribution costs. It garnered some positive reviews from Odd Nugget, Power Popaholic, and Steve Simels.

After the release of “Cherry Springs” came the single “Christmas Magic” in 2017, the “Faded Photographs I: Sepia Tone” EP in spring 2018, and the “Take in the Night” single in summer of 2018. Each of these releases, though stylistically different all built upon the standard of quality set by “Cherry Springs.”

With the first half of 2018 seeing three releases, you’d think that the rest of the year would be a little calm… well, you’d be wrong. Mike Brunacini is currently is the process of contributing to the score of indie film “Empire,” producing Paul Jackino’s second album, and finishing up his own fourth album “DreamState.” This massive double album has truly been in the works for about 11 years. Started in 2007, the album has been picked up and placed on the backburner many times. It’s seen its share of changes as well. “DreamState” is more a rock opera than a general concept album, as there is a narrative arc and characters. The whole thing feels very cinematic. It’s the sort of album you’d want to listen to with headphones on and the lights off. Imagine prog rock textures blended in with power-pop hooks and a dash of strings and horns.

“DreamState” is in the process of being mixed now and you can expect to hear more about it very soon!:::3716:::687:::0.12578044267560395:::0.3356906623842108:::2:::0:::2012|||"

About Rebecca Ramsay:

A great mate of Mark Henry's from the days when Mark owned a knife company and Rebecca owned a bistro. They loved each other's work and they and their families have been close ever since. Mark moved on to pans (among other things!) and Rebecca moved on to executive coaching and directorships. We were fortunate when Rebecca graciously accepted the assignment of Solidteknics Australia Kickstarter coordinator. Not just an awesome salt-of-the-earth mate, but whip-smart and eminently capable. Perfect qualities to keep day-to-day Kickstarter duties on track!

Latitune bars all well known artists, making it possible for up-and-coming artists to become masters of their own realm. Once an artist reaches a certain level of national notoriety and significant quantifiable performance on the site, the artist will be ""Retired/Graduated"" from the site, and moves on to the ""Hall of Fame"". That artist is removed from the rankings making it possible for the #2 artist to move up to the #1 position by respective genre.

I won several of art awards, along with the principle painting award. I then continued on teaching, in Foundation drawing, at Carnegie Mellon for the next five years, in addition to several other universities in the Pittsburgh area. I received a Fulbright in 1990 and, lived and traveled in Ireland and Western Europe for a year though my art. Painting and drawing the monolithic ancient structures and sweeping landscapes, I exhibited extensively throughout the country, in addition to the Pittsburgh area. Since I have been a full time professional artist, my works hang in the Ambassador’s residence, hospital lobbies, private and commercial collections that are displayed in Pittsburgh and along the east coast and New York City. I made my residence in Pittsburgh because of its cool fun neighborhoods, history and eclectic culture and, proceeded to purchase an old general store, which I renovated into a Gallery and a loft, where I hosted many art openings that inspired opening a winery. The passion and interest in wines inspired me to buy a small, one room school house in northwestern Pa., near Cook Forest. The property it was on offered a perfect setting to build a winery and continue with my passion for wine and everything about it. The R**Bandana Winery was established in 2012 in Leeper, Pa, serving as the production space, an art gallery, as well as a performance and gathering space. However, a huge economic hit in the area, (three factories closing) requiring the business to expand and replicate in a satellite operation in Franklin, Pa., which is also doing extremely well. Although in an economically depressed area. I have now identified the necessity to open within a larger population area, Homestead, The Waterfront, Pittsburgh. While the eclectic, cozy atmosphere provided at both locations helps, the quality of the product we offer is actually the key.:::2035:::338:::0.10326704545454546:::0.3300568181818182:::1:::0:::2017|||"

He even started working helping the FACTS comicon organization where he also met the founder of Broken Frontier and shortly thereafter began doing headlines for this news site.

I remember as a kid and all my life I knew I wanted to be an “inventor"". I live in Austin,TX and last year I quit my job to follow my dream of designing full time. For years I dreamed of creating a very thin watch. The watch had to be stylish and very comfortable on top of being ultra thin. I took the idea even further with the challenge to create the thinnest watch ever. Back then the idea seemed impossible, so I started with something very basic and raised the bar slowly but eventually I came to realize that it was impossible!

Well, it has been many months, several hundred hours of work, an awesome
team, and most importantly full commitment to this project. Finally, I want to help education in my area so I have chosen two schools which I know do their best to take education to the next level.

That woodgrain print is embedded in my mind. I still collect cards to this day, but have gravitated towards non-sports. There is something special about non-sports cards in that they are always relevant. Mark Hamill will never be traded to another team and will forever be Luke Skywalker. Ron Perlman will not pull his hamstring and miss the next 4-6 ""games"" of Hellboy. I developed the itch to produce my own set in 2014, but always had a reason not to pursue it. Since then I've spent time talking to many of the small presses who continue to put out innovative and fun non sports sets. With their support and generous knowledge sharing I've decided to take the plunge.

In late 2015, we converted our attic into heated/cooled livable square footage.

In the past I started with handmade projects, such as wallets, shoes, purses, bags and other personal items. I wanted to have the ability to take my comics with me everywhere and share them. All the work was comic themed, or creator owned series based. After years in this business, I wanted to challenge myself and build upon what I loved, and that was comics. For the years, I have loved, shared and created comics and art in many different ways. I started with a soft launch of Naughty Faeries, which was very well received. Kickstarter became my opportunity to start the next chapter in my life, comic creator and publisher with more people, beautiful artwork from some of my favorite artists and get more exposure to a project that I really enjoyed working on, with a team of incredibly talented people.

This past summer, Naughty Faeries Stripper Assassins, was successful funded in our first Kickstarter campaign, thanks to the amazing backers who have made it possible. Thank you so much for your support.

In January 2019, we launched a Kickstarter Make 100 campaign for Alex Kotkin's cover from our first Kickstarter, which were silver foil Embossed 8x10 prints, which was successfully funded in a couple hours.

The third Kickstarter, will continue the story of ""Naughty Faeries Stripper Assassins"" comic series, book 2 ""Balor's Rath.""

Our fourth Kickstarter, The Art of Naughty Faeries. This book collected the concepts, artwork, sketches, covers and stories for the first 2 books, with sneak peaks and book three.

Naughty Faeries Stripper Assassins #3 was our most successful kickstarter to date! We beat all the records and exceeded our expectations. We hope you can join us and support this journey in to the grimdark fantasy world of Naughty Stripper Faeries. This is a Special Kikcstarter for virtural Comic Con with the Naughty Faeries Theme. We are featuring various artists who have been involved int he project and offering unique items at their Artist Alley tables (pledge levels). We hope you enjoy your adventure at the Naughty Faeries comic con.

"1174653512:::894089644:::Kronecker Wallis:::Kronecker Wallis is an idea that came to fruition over many sleepless nights. It’s a personal project, but is backed by a large team of experienced professionals.

  My name is Jordi and I’m from Barcelona.  

I’ve always loved books ever since I can remember. As ""something to touch and look at"", not just read.

  I’m not a novels man, 99.99% of what I read is non-fiction (history, the history of science, biographies, psychology and philosophy) or technical (for work).

  It’s no surprise that when I have to kill time before a meeting, I go into a bookshop instead of a café. I love looking at books, studying their design, touching them... I could spend all day buying them.  A few years ago, the idea of starting my own publishing house started spinning through my head, for a romantic rather than practical reason. I imagined a small premises crammed with books and wooden furniture. Like the ones on http://bookshelfporn.com/, a place to spend hours and hours reading, and to be able to make a living from it, just scraping by, for sure.

  When I was young, at home there were shelves full of books on architecture and interior design. I also liked finding out how things work. So I spent all day mixing liquids that I found in the kitchen, or doing homemade experiments.

  One day, when I was quite small, I don’t think I was even 9 years old, I asked my parents for a birthday gift of a box full of plugs, cables, bulbs, batteries, screws... all sorts of things for my inventions.  

Another year, for Christmas I asked for a microscope and spent weeks looking at everything that came to hand. Then I asked for a telescope (eventually I had three) and spent hours looking at the moon. I think I was between 7 and 12 years old.  

Then came my teenage years, with the wonderful Beakman’s World (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beakman%27s_World) on the TV. What more could I ask for. The seed had been planted.  

The subject of philosophy at secondary school influenced me a lot. It was my first contact with psychology, logic, the discovery of ideas and human evolution, as well as the great names of western philosophical thinking, along with their personal history.  

The world opened up to me. And I started to read and read and read...  

And in the meantime... I kept going into bookshops. For hours, I leafed through any book on art, the design of Japanese gardens, typography, interior design (hotels, offices...), photography...  

All of this made me grow inside. Although my reading habit diminished a great deal due to lack of time, the romantic idea of owning a publishing house, looking at books from small independent publishers... it was too tempting.  

So autumn 2015 arrived and I couldn’t take it any more. Thirty-seven years and too many nights mulling over the idea.  I can’t remember the exact eureka moment. In 2015, I might have been reading A Short History of Nearly Everything or At Home: A Short History of Private Life by Bill Bryson, or A History of Western Philosophy by Bertrand Russel, when my eyes started to open on a thousand and one important characters and works that had been forgotten. Names and books that deserved to be enjoyed.  

I finished the year reading Fermat's Enigma by Simon Singh, as another nine books remained piled up on my office desk. It was probably reading this book, with a couple of references to Newton, that caused the lightbulb moment.

  I went to search the Internet for any information I could find on the Principia... I had already decided that it should be the publishing house’s first book.  

So in January 2016, the adventure began.:::3650:::646:::0.1616117216117216:::0.27489926739926734:::7:::5:::2016|||"

"904669009:::1783793894:::Nazario Vidone:::Hello everyone, I apologize for my imperfect English. My name is Nazario Vidone, I am an Italian geologist. I lived my first 19 years in a small town of 5000 inhabitants, called Gatteo, in Italy. I've always been very passionate about nature, animals, outdoor life, even technology and many sports. I'm hyperactive, very curious about everything, I always disassembled toys to see and understand how they worked. Initially I wanted to become an archaeologist, but in the end I enrolled at the University of Bologna in Geology, my goal was to do an outdoor work and also useful for the environment and public health. To maintain my studies I have done many jobs, often with difficulty and effort. I am a humble person, and I like manual work, I am also a professional bicycle mechanic, I repaired and restored vintage bicycles. I'm also a speleologist. I also worked as a model maker, ie creating foundry molds to make engine parts for Ferrari, Lamborghini, Maserati ... a very hard and very precise job. Unfortunately, the work is now in short supply, so I am trying to carry out some of my projects in the drawer for so many years, but I need financial contributions, dear supporters. Thanks to your help I will be able to put into practice and finally realize ideas and projects that will not only benefit me, but I hope for anyone who will want to use them. Thank you very much for your time you have dedicated to me.
Thanks even if you do not want to support my project. A special thanks to all the staff of Kickstarter because they had a brilliant idea, able to give the opportunity to me and to all those who, like me, do not have the money to be able to see their ideas, intuitions, projects that could give work to themselves, to collaborators / employees, and contribute to the benefit of everyone with the realization of innovative ideas.:::1849:::330:::0.12238492063492062:::0.4018306878306878:::3:::0:::2018|||"

One of them involves applying several layers of paper and tearing them in a controlled manner, so as to obtain an irregular surface, like in posters of movies that you can see in the street. Those are the big city skyline in general. I also do portraits and nudes in large sizes. I use canvas roll so I feel free to work - I need a big white surface, and when the work is finished I choose the right size. I like acrylics because it gives me execution speed, and can be corrected at any time. As well as brushes of medium size, I also use spatulas, knives, sandpaper, rags, spray water, and step on the surface. Everything is instinctive, without a precise logic, when something goes well, I do not touch it anymore. The finished works are rough, irregular, uneven to the touch.

I wanted to create an experiential costume that was based on a vintage penny arcade fortune teller (the old lady in the glass box) and I wanted to dispense single fortune cards to bring the experience full circle. Being it was in Salem, authenticity was very important to me, so I researched the subject of tarot tirelessly, but I also felt somehow guided in the creation of this deck, which became a true labor of love for me. The fortunes needed to be genuine to the cards, but I wanted them to be mysterious and also a little kitschy, if you will.

Once the fascination of the research swept me up with inspiration, I kept going. In keeping with this brand, I have decided to keep my true identity quiet and secondary to the Madam Clara pen-name, aka Clara Vaduva. I hope you enjoy the deck!:::1086:::195:::0.1043915343915344:::0.36241181657848326:::4:::8:::2016|||"

"1150996029:::793326448:::NerdyKeppie:::If you can't find it, make it yourself, and make it right: NerdyKeppie's philosophy and business model grew out of one family's need for representation. When Spider Perry's daughter Cat wanted a sturdy, cute transgender Pride yarmulke, the mother/daughter pair scoured the internet and came up dry. Spider took matters into their own hands - literally - and developed the first of NerdyKeppie's products. In the two and a half years since they sold their first yarmulke, NerdyKeppie has expanded to include Spider's spouse Steve. Their shop now centers not just around Spider's knitting needles but includes two embroidery machines and an industrial sewing machine, and their offerings have grown to nearly a thousand items: patches, t-shirts, swimsuits and activewear. Many of those items are made in their home-based studio in Pennsylvania - studio might be generous, it's half their bedroom and most of their dining room - and what they can't physically produce is outsourced to a US-based network of manufacturers. The core of the company remains ""two adults, three machines, three dogs and a teenager,"" a tight-knit structure that allows them to stay close to the LGBTQ community, their main focus.
