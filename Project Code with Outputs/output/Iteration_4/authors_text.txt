"1946614754:::2082702714:::VentoNuovo Games:::Emanuele Santandrea was born in Milan in 1973.

Summa cum Laude in Genetics, his father was an officer in the Italian elite unit Brigata Paracadutisti Folgore, Emanuele served as a corporal in the most decorated unit of the Italian Army, the 3° Reggimento Bersaglieri.

Emanuele has played historical wargames since he was a child.
He also writes novels, screenplays, and directs movies.
His last novel, Il Dottor Ricordi, challenged for Premio Strega and won 2 International Literary Awards.

He started VentoNuovo Games in 2012, with particular focus on the artwork, both on maps and counters.

He writes: ""Some say VNG works 'harder than we need to' on small details of texture and color… but we believe these things add to the feeling of a good game… like a 'new breeze.' (which is what Vento Nuovo means).""

“One of the battles which has captured my attention the most is Stalingrad. Some think it odd that I have published eight games and none about Stalingrad, until now. I knew I was not satisfied with the games that were available for several reasons. Recently released documents have allowed me to provide a much more accurate Order of Battle for both sides, including units that were present (but left out of most games) and taking out units that weren’t there. And then I saw the Luftwaffe recon photos and knew what auto/Cad could do… that was the inspiration.”

VentoNuovo has a great record with Kickstarter. The first project, Moscow '41, shipped two months EARLIER than promised (is that legal?) and Leningrad '41 shipped over three months early, while Bloody Monday was also almost 2 months earlier than scheduled, and almost the same for ""Stalingrad: Inferno on the Volga"". ""I try to make smart promises and then take them very seriously,"" is his explanation. Another explanation is not depending on ships coming from Asia but handling all the production in the EU. Now he is working on ""Kiev '41"" to complete the Barbarossa Trilogy started with ""Moscow '41"" and ""Leningrad '41."":::2013:::340:::0.10391113516113518:::0.28640021244187913:::5:::6:::2016|||"

My passion in life is to help people to take their knowledge, experiences, and skill sets to translate them into real products and services that will make a positive difference to others and make a profit for them. I believe that happiness is where people work and succeed while staying with their family and friends.
Today, I have a Film Project to fulfill. There are many pieces of evidence. This film project is a mission born of the duty to awaken the conscience of the peoples of the world and to warn African dictators about their poor governance of our countries, pushing young people to mass immigration to the West in the boats to perish in the sea, to perpetuate their dynasty. We approach this with passion as an opportunity and an urgency. This project is a subject that we have to talk about and explain because we are all in this boat. Otherwise, we will all slip slowly and sink together. Please Think about hundreds of thousands of young talents and geniuses, who are dying in this adventure. The West is not a paradise!!
We need your contribution to achieve this mission and make the film alive. Please help us with your donation.:::1726:::297:::0.09678030303030302:::0.26496212121212126:::1:::2:::2018|||"

"1448190121:::1139696419:::toni childs:::“...evocative, evanescent music that allows you to immerse yourself and drift away.”
Rolling Stone, USA

“In a year of auspicious breakthroughs for women writer-performers, Childs was the standout.”
Time Magazine USA

To understand the kind of whimsical, passionate person Emmy winner and three-time Grammy nominated recording artist, installation artist, yoga teacher, and environmental activist Toni Childs is, one must hear her tell the story of a dream she had when she was 21.

“In this dream, I’m standing next to a stone balustrade in front of a French chateau in the Hollywood hills. Which you can
do in the Hollywood hills and you can do in a dream. From this vantage point, I’m looking down on the city and watching the city lights come online in big sections across the valley. It’s a clear night, not a cloud in the sky. In front of me off in the distance, I can see the silhouette of the Angeles Crest mountain range—black, crisp, like the night air. It’s the time of year when the sun goes down and you can feel the bite on your skin, and the moisture in the air and the brisk, clean beautiful smell of damp earth. Behind this silhouette is a massive bandwidth of orange where the sun has set. The bandwidth of orange is so big I have to look straight up into the night sky to see where the orange
turns into a turquoise blue and the first star comes out. It’s an epic moment. I feel at peace - a massive sense of wellbeing - contentment really. I find myself fully leaning into this stunning moment, and then something catches my attention. I turn to look, and behind me I notice two very tall narrow French doors leading into the Chateau, and inside is a full-blown Hollywood party with people smokin and drinkin, and being all fabulous! The music is blasting, but I don’t want to go in. I just want to turn around and look back at this beautiful view. But as I turn my head to look back at the view something catches my eye, and behind the far right door,s I’m facing the chateau, there’s a woman, and she’s floating a foot off the ground. She has no clothes on and no hair on her body. And her body is like a jelly fish - somewhat transparent - not an apparition - her body and anatomy are clearly like ours. Yet, I would say she’s a combination box jellyfish/gecko. Ok... what I mean is her body like a gecko – you know how you can see their eggs inside their belly. I could see her ovaries and her heart beating inside her breast. Her neck and arms and breast were clear like a jellyfish but the torso of her body was transparent like the body of a gecko. I became fascinated and found myself moving in drinking in her anatomy. I noticed she had a blue caste to her body and I thought, ""Oh it’s because our veins are blue."" I could see her neck vein pulsing, and as I watched it I could see fluid systems moving. I got so wrapped up in her anatomy I forgot there was a person attached to the body I was so enthralled with. So, when I finally looked in her eyes almost by accident, I freaked out! She said, ""don’t be afraid!”, but her lips didn’t move. ""Did you just talk inside my head? She said, ‘When you reach a certain moment in your human development, you’ll no long be afraid to allow people know what you think or feel.""
Looking down I thought for a moment, 'that sounds right.' ""Who are you?"" looking into her eyes. ""I’m your future self’, and I woke up.”

Meeting my future self all those years ago gave me a trajectory – a star on the distant horizon to point my compass toward. I have now shared this dream with people in more than 20 countries around the world. I believe Mik’s music created a portal for my future self to come through. The impact this story, and the new music from It’s All a Beautiful Noise has on people is really something special to experience. As part of ‘The Show’ I will share my dream moment in a more dynamic way by allowing my future self to come to life. I want to give my future self the opportunity to sing and talk directly to you. Reflecting back what she thinks is happening on planet earth. And her great hope for humanity.:::4103:::807:::0.0752288271800467:::0.34275919766773427:::3:::4:::2011|||"

"1704592942:::1538983106:::Robin Snyder:::WHO ARE SNYDER AND DITKO?
IN THE BEGINNING
Sharon Levine and Gavin Callaghan, among other readers, have asked about our early produced material, how we got together, where have we been, how and why we began self-publishing and so forth. Here is a recap for those who missed the story in the pages of The Comics! Snyder has written and edited stories and books including Batman, Katy Keene, Popeye, Steel Sterling, Turok, Son of Stone, and more. Ditko, the original artist on Spider-Man, Dr. Strange, Captain Atom, Dr. Haunt, Konga, Gorgo and others, can also be found in an astonishing list of titles: The Fantastic Four and The Incredible Hulk to The Many Ghosts of Doctor Graves and Witzend. Snyder and Ditko began working together at DC and went on to a variety of publishers, ever seeking opportunity, new ground. You may have seen or heard of some of this work: Charlton Action featuring Static, Flash Gordon, Gobots, The Missing Man, Murder, Tales of the Mysterious Traveler, etc.

EXPLORERS
After years of working for others we struck out on our own. From 1988 to date we have continued earlier features and/or introduced a variety of new characters, concepts and publications. We have published 65 books, hundreds of articles and essays, our little periodical, The Four-Page Series, and the first-person history, The Comics!, now in its 30th year of publication.
	
NEXT
All of this is in the past and present. Up ahead Spring

"174015938:::1289522009:::Feder & Schwert:::Feder & Schwert ist ein unabhängiger Spezialverlag für alle Bereiche der Phantastik. Seit 1989 veröffentlichen wir Bücher in den Bereichen Fantasy, Dark Fantasy, Urban Fantasy, Steampunk, Horror, Science-Fiction und Krimi. Zu den Bestsellern des Verlagsprogramms gehört unter Anderem die Vampir-Trilogie Vorübergehend tot, Untot in Dallas und Club Dead von Charlaine Harris, die Elemente klassischer Vampir-Literatur mit Romantasy verbindet und unter dem Titel True Blood sehr erfolgreich als Fernsehserie gelaufen ist.

Gegründet wurde der Verlag 1989 von Phantastikbegeisterten aus der Metropolregion Mannheim als Rollenspielverlag. Rollen- oder Erzählspiele sind Spiele des So-Tuns-als-ob, des Erzählens. Dabei übernehmen die Spieler die Rollen imaginierter Charaktere und erleben selbst handelnd Abenteuer in einer mehr oder weniger phantastischen Welt. Es gibt also in aller Regel weder Spielbrett noch Karten. Wichtige Bestandteile dieser Spielform sind: soziale Interaktion, virtuelle Spannungsszenarien, die Verwandlung des Ich in andere Gestalten, das virtuelle Erleben von und Agieren an anderen Schauplätzen und erfolgreiches Lösen gestellter Aufgaben.

Im Jahre 2016 kehrte Feder & Schwert gewissermaßen wieder zu diesen Wurzeln zurück, denn neuer Geschäftsführer wurde Patric Götz vom Uhrwerk Verlag, einem ebensolchen Rollenspielverlag. Nach dem Umzug nach Köln ist Feder & Schwert nun der Schwesterverlag des Uhrwerk Verlages und begeht mit der Veröffentlichung der an Rollenspielwelten angelehnten Romanreihen Splittermond und Pathfinder Saga altbekannte, und doch auch wieder neue Wege.:::1607:::210:::-1.3877787807814458e-18:::0.07250000000000001:::3:::0:::2017|||"

"1202493006:::189290632:::Heather Shreckengost:::Born in the Appalachian Mountains, I was destined for a life that would lead to children, marriage and a log cabin in the woods. I would be happy because that’s what you do, right? With my high-school sweetheart leading the way, my destiny was set. And then I went to college and realized I don’t want any of that. I’m too creative and too different to live in a small town in Western Pennsylvania, so upon graduating college, I left. I moved to Washington, DC and landed a job at Discovery and was happy. I did things I thought I'd never do and survived. The joy of living in a diverse city lasted several years, but then I maximized my experience and left. With the Colorado Rockies calling my name, I moved to Boulder, CO and a heart opening journey began. For a while it made sense. I tried working for others, I tried to be cool and perfect. I softened. I tried to dampen my curiosity and let go of my tom-boy ways. I tried, and tried, and tried to fit in and then I turned 40 and realized, I’m living someone else's path. During that phase I maxed out my credit cards, I quit amazing jobs to go to start-ups, I cried, a lot. I allowed myself to be in relationships that were unbalanced, distracting and weakening because of my own instability and uncertainty. I was alone, a lot. But, through all of the risk, I’m still here. Now, I live in Santa Fe, NM where I feel safe to share my gifts, embrace the weirdness, throw a tantrum, apologize, forgive, trust and give to the world. I am humbled everyday by my choices and astonished by the path of creative living. I’m blessed to be alive, to be surrounded by so many big hearted givers, and to live in a time where my ideas are actually new and my vision is clear. My intention is to expand my ideas, to inspire and to support others along their journey of authentic living. A writer, a producer, a maker of things, this is a big leap of faith in the direction of living fully. My contribution is to stop hiding and to become the confident, trusting and creative woman that the world sees. It’s not as scary as I thought and truthfully, it’s the only way I know how to be. My projects are my gifts, I hope you delight in them as equally as you delight in knowing you’re not alone in your path to enlightenment or whatever this thing is about!:::2297:::454:::0.2145854145854146:::0.38137834387834385:::1:::0:::2019|||"

At that time I made my first animated cartoon A STORY ABOUT A LITTLE MOUSE, – wrote a poem, narrated it, created puppets, filmed and edited my story. This cartoon was aired on TV. In 1992 I and my mother immigrated to the United States where I earned professional degree in TV production.

"1063105731:::1964805017:::Joshua Davis:::Joshua Davis was raised in the folk tradition: the music, the social movements, the land. He writes songs that blend the roots of American music with gritty rock n' roll and vintage soul. Performing Songwriter Magazine called the result, ""Some of the liveliest and most rocking roots music around.""

Speaking or singing, the voice of Joshua Davis is a disarming instrument: weathered and warm, as capable of conjuring confessional intimacy on a global stage as it is of making a small room, well off the beaten path, resonate with startling urgency and power. Couple it with an earnest poetic sensibility, a boundless work ethic, and an uncanny gift for connecting with audiences spanning generations, and it’s no wonder that Davis is now poised at the brink of the sort of widespread recognition that typically passes right over such a humble troubadour. Over the past fifteen years, Michigan-based Davis has honed an impressive range of skills – songwriter, bandleader, guitarist, and vocalist among them – in the most honest possible fashion: night after night, song after song, show after show Davis simply delivered every performance as though his life depended on it. Investing himself in the American musical diaspora, he has explored the common thread connecting folk, blues, jazz, ragtime, and country forms – discovering his personal perspective as a composer in the process. “My sound is rooted in the folk tradition,” Davis explains, “but it’s not folk music. Terms like Americana, roots rock, and heartland rock come up, but there’s so much more to it than that. I’m not a purist: I play with that American folk lineage, I play with those metaphors.” His versatility and ravenous musical curiosity has resulted in a divergent output, from his five albums with roots rock outfit Steppin’ In It to the vintage swing styles documented on the album he recorded with Shout Sister Shout. But Davis’s sensibility shines brightest on his trio of solo albums, each a thoughtful dispatch on life, love, change, and growth, culminating with 2013’s A Miracle of Birds – which was inspired by a life-changing voyage to Middle East in the Palestinian West Bank to raise money and awareness for fair-trade olive farming communities in Palestine’s West Bank. Contrasting his identity as an American Jew with the struggles he observed in the Middle East, Davis crafted a suite of songs that works not only as a traditional album, but as a provocative and dynamic concert program that he presented in schools, clubs, and theaters. Following the release of A Miracle of Birds, Davis could well have continued his journeyman existence, gradually growing his audience one show at a time as he and his talented bandmates tirelessly careen up and down the highways between home and the next gig. Instead, what happened next was an unlikely convergence of a contemporary pop phenomenon and his decidedly old-school methodology, while handily proving the old adage that there is no such thing as a genuine overnight sensation. Davis almost didn’t audition when the popular NBC musical showcase The Voice called. “I’d never even seen the show. Looking at music in a competitive way is totally against the way I was raised,” he says. “Collaboration is what it’s about. Music brings people together. So the competitive aspect of it was really foreign – to be judged like that.” From his first performance, Davis triumphed, and over the course of the season, his rootsy, sincere approach emerged as a refreshing alternative and propelled him all the way to finals. “Looking back, it was good to be under the gun for a little bit, to look closely at the way I perform,” he recalls. “I didn’t think of myself as a singer before this happened – I thought of myself as a songwriter first. My goal throughout the whole surreal experience was to just maintain the respect and integrity that I’ve staked my career on so far. The amount of support I received from new and old fans has been mind-blowing. A lot of people were just happy that the kind of stuff I do reached the mainstream, and that I actually got an original piece of music [his stirring ‘The Workingman’s Hymn’] on the show.” The unexpected gift of an instant national audience has given Davis a rare, once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, and he is careful when considering its implications and possibilities. “The people who have been with me for the past fifteen years understand this wide scope of American music that influences everything I do,” he says. “I want to show my new listeners this range – which wasn’t always on display on the show.” The combination of his recent success and his long journey to get there is inspiring a new batch of songs, still in their “larval form,” as Davis puts it. But he’s still doing things as he always have: Walking into the studio with his guitar, his songs, and his band, counting off, and rolling tape – taking the performance live off the floor, with little post-production sweetening. “More than anything else, it’s really important to me to show people that you don’t need to rely on studio tricks and cheats to make a great album,” he says. “The music I love is raw and organic and it’s perfectly flawed. If more people are listening, I’d like that to be highlighted a little bit more. That’s where I see my place: Playing music that’s a little more raw, that’s a little more organic, that lives and breaths. And also that’s timeless in some way.” “More than ever,” Davis concludes, “I want to put everything I can into the music I write and the music I make. I’m proud of what I’ve done in the past, but this has made me look at my life and my work differently. And what it comes down to is the people around me: The people I’ve met, the people who supported me from the beginning and during The Voice – the people I’ve been around, the people I’ve been exposed to, the support, the community that surrounded me, my family – the way they sacrificed and helped set me up. I want to make the most of this.”:::5995:::1117:::0.15823250630542296:::0.4094240867157534:::4:::47:::2010|||"

"1587278763:::1464630014:::S.L. Guyon, Architect and Composer:::S.L. Guyon, has been a practicing architect for the last three decades. He has completed dozens of projects and is the recipient of (13) AIA Awards for Design Excellence. His background also includes the study of music with American composer Bill Dixon. Dixon was a founding member of the Jazz Composers Orchestra in New York in the 1960s. Guyon is, by nature, interdisciplinary and the Creativity Center is very much in harmony with his talents. His academic background includes membership in the inaugural class at Hampshire College in 1970, as well as, cycles of study at the Art Institute of Chicago, Pratt Institute and Rhode Island School of Design. His professional degree in architecture was conferred, with honors, by the College of Architecture-University of Kentucky in 1983.


Guyon founded the Studio for Architecture in 1985 and joined the faculty of the College of Architecture the following year. And for the next 13 years he taught design studio at all levels while growing his practice. During this period he was honored with the AIAS/AIA award for Outstanding Practitioner in Education and the 1999 Silver Medal for Distinguished Service from Tau Sigma Delta, the Honor Society in Architecture and Allied Arts.


Also during this time, Guyon developed his unique concept of the New Native House, a fusion of the Southern vernacular and the modernism of Le Corbusier and Alvar Alto that creates something that is at once fresh, unexpected and familiar. In his 2004 book, American Houses Today: New Southern Houses (Watson-Guptill), Guyon expounds upon this concept and illustrates 11 of his award-wining, New Native Houses.


Guyon credits the 1959 jazz album, Kind of Blue by Miles Davis and Bill Evans, for much of the inspiration for his New Native concept; ""At the level of true content,” he says, ""Davis and Evans perform together in a way that could be called ‘New Native,’ with their play of opposites – structure versus improvisation, rational versus romantic, and density versus space.” These beautiful and charged opposites can be transposed into the making of Architecture.

"1525975163:::1759914814:::D20 Collective:::Hey Guys, my name's Doug Johnson and I'm the owner of D20 Collective. Years ago, I was introduced to Dungeons and Dragons. I friend of mine asked me to join him in a game session. I had already been playing persistent world Roleplaying servers on Neverwinter Nights so the thought of getting into a role play group sounded very enticing!

Needless to say, I was addicted.

But amidst my new addiction..there was one underlying question that always crossed my mind:

“Why weren't more people playing this amazing game?!”

- FAST FORWARD NEARLY 15 YEARS -
Life had pressed on, I had kids, got married, started a new career at a software company - you know, adulting.

But my passion and hunger for Dungeons and Dragons, Pathfinder and other tabletop games had only grown exponentially...however the burning question stayed:

“Why weren't more people playing these games?”

The answer was fairly apparent: AWARENESS

So I had a small itch to start a simple Facebook page called Dungeons and Dragons Memes. I figured if I did my part at bringing awareness and entertainment to this starving industry every little bit helps, right?

...little did I know…

What started as a small social idea to bring awareness to tabletop gaming grew into something larger. Much. Much larger...

In August of 2014 the page had roughly 2,500 to 5,000 fans. I would make a few posts every week, we'd get several hundred likes, a handful of shares and we were a small community of individuals who shared a passion for Tabletop Gaming.

But I decided to keep going. I didn't want to stop there.

Fast forward to today and DnD Memes is nearly HALF A MILLION strong and currently the largest tabletop gaming page on Facebook WORLDWIDE.


On February of 2015 I quit my comfy software job of 8 years and began to pursue my passion of all things Tabletop Gaming full time. In June of 2015 I started D20 Collective.

And the rest is history.

Through the first two years, I continued to build D20 Collective by working late nights and weekends coming up with new designs and products. Each new release received an enthusiastic response from the community. My dream of being part of a movement was no longer just a dream. It was happening!

- IT'S MORE THAN JUST PRODUCTS. IT'S STARTING A MOVEMENT. - Sure, running D20 Collective pays the bills, puts food on the table and provides for my family - but it's so much more than that!

It helps bring awareness to the masses that Dungeons and Dragons and other tabletop games aren't boring or outdated - they are far from it! They develop life skills such as math, critical thinking, social development and camaraderie.

D20 Collective and DnD Memes has always been about passion over sales. In my eyes, if we just introduce 1 new person a month to Tabletop gaming then we've done our part! Too many people and too much of our Youth spend their days hiding behind a computer, phone or TV screen. Our mission is to help change that.

To date: We’ve shipped to over 25 countries around the world. We have over 20,000 customers, we have multiple vendors on board and we are a driving force in helping to fund Tabletop gaming related Kickstarters such as the Gamer's Series, Elderwood Academy and many others. - NEVER LOSING SIGHT -
""Even as we grow, one thing that I’ve always wanted for D20 Collective is to maintain the personal touch.

I try to be as transparent as possible and no matter how big we become I will always answer any email personally that is sent to me.

Who knows what the future will bring, but what we are striving for is to be the go to place for all things tabletop gaming. We plan on bringing more exclusive products, games and designs to our ever-increasing store.

THANK YOU in advance for being a backer of our project - without you - we genuinely are nothing. Afterall...YOU are our Natural 20!:::3882:::686:::0.0669374494069616:::0.3249610653574069:::2:::6:::2017|||"

I certainly hope ‘Crouched Tube’ is a successful launch that allows me to do this.

"922150976:::1576979954:::Allen Clapp:::The first time I cold-called Clapp back in the '90s—no need to use a publicist since he didn't have one—was for an interview for a story about Allen Clapp and his Orchestra’s debut album, One Hundred Percent Chance of Rain, to be published by revered indie-rock mag The Bob. He was living in Redwood City, halfway between San Francisco and San Jose, and was working for a local newspaper. Unlike some music contacts, he seemed most congenial. I learned the basics about Clapp. He was a UC Berkeley grad who also took music history classes. He's a practicing member of his local Lutheran church and is particularly well spoken (My mom would have loved him). And now the interesting stuff. Surprisingly, this God-fearing man was associated in his callow youth with some kids who went on to form the Mummies. They were an uncontrollable rock band from Clapp's hometown, Foster City, Calif. so rank they arrived at local clubs in a vintage Pontiac ambulance and created havoc onstage, busting rented PAs while stumbling around in rotting rags and trailing foul strips of gauze. ""Those stage get-ups smelled awful after a while,"" says Clapp who tossed public light fixtures into nearby San Francisco Bay back in the '80s with some of those same future Mummies as an act of teenage rebellion. He's probably still going to confession for associating with such uncouth fellows. Oh no, those are the Catholics, sorry.

In the late '90s, Clapp and his wife Jill Pries bought a house in Sunnyvale, about 15 miles closer to San Jose in the heart of Silicon Valley. ""It's an Eichler and we're fixing it up,"" he would excitedly tell me of the flat-top ""mid-century modern"" tract home, a breed that flourished 50 years ago. He lightly skewers Sunnyvale these days—a town with no music scene, whatsoever (except for him)—as ""the vale of sun."" Before relocating, Clapp had started a band called the Orange Peels with himself on vocals/rhythm guitar and Jill's bass as the only permanent members. It was a worthy vehicle for the brilliant pop songs Clapp was creating then, little gems that occasionally brought back memories of '60s pop/rock titans the Zombies and Herman's Hermits. A signature element of much of the zesty material he penned for the Orange Peels was its use of foul-weather imagery. ""Rain is something I've always found appealing,"" he told me in an interview for another indie-rock magazine, Magnet. His love of rain, he must have realized by now, is a strange choice for someone dwelling in ""the vale of sun."" Skipping over most of the mundane moments since then—taking out the garbage, mowing the lawn, vacuuming his Eichler—just about brings us to the present and the (hopefully) triumphant return of Allen Clapp and his Orchestra. Cue the baroque trumpet voluntary, and roll in that phalanx of keyboards, if you please. Created at his own Mystery Lawn Studio, which now occupies the garage space where his vintage Maserati once grazed, Mixed Greens is an entirely new breed of cat. ""Picnic At The Hermitage"" is a sweeping instrumental whose piano and synths, floating on a thin bed of industrial noise, turn the unwrapping of sandwiches and the opening of a jar of fresh ants outside Andrew Jackson's ancestral home into a cinematic moment (or maybe it's the museum of the same name in St. Petersburg, Russia, who knows?). ""Downfall No. 3"" has something of the right-hand turn Brian Wilson once made when he ditched surf 'n' psych for the soulful sounds of ""Wild Honey."" ""All Or Nothing"" adds something new to the morning weather report: an overriding sense of melancholy. And the majestic ""Treeline,"" with its stepladder modulations and heart-wrenching vocals, leads the man into virgin forests and blazing New World sunsets.

I'll always love the Orange Peels, but this stunning body of new material is, to borrow an early album title from Ornette Coleman, something else. It sounds so right, like something he'd never have dared to do before. Just Allen wailing away in front of his keyboards, flying off to faraway horizons that even he never imagined possible. This is the music Allen Clapp was born to create. Welcome aboard and please keep those seatbelts buckled.

"1752084284:::2027874908:::Jeszika Le Vye:::Recently, I was asked what I love to paint. I replied that I love to paint the inner workings of the human mind - the psychology, the subconscious, the motivations and choices of the characters in my paintings. It felt wrong, because it wasn’t a tangible answer such as I like painting portraits or oceanscapes. But it felt right because that truly is the heart of my art.

I have always had a strong love for scifi and fantasy, for mythology. In these genres, the parameters of reality are altered just enough to explore questions of human nature, ethics, and metaphysics from an angle slightly askew and thus yield interesting insights and questions. I think this is also one of the reasons I love Imaginative Realism so much - it allows me the classical quality of realism that I have loved since I was a young child, but also, that something more - that what if? I am extremely curious, love learning and I read and collect books at a rate that is almost obsessive without any intention of slowing down! It makes sense that I have come to love creating books as much I love reading them! I am one of the owners of Boneshaker Press, a company where we are hard at work creating beautiful books of art and story. (We are about to begin our 3rd Volume of Encounters with the Imaginary in early 2018!)

He enjoys creating products that will have a delightful impact on the user. His approach to design is process and material driven while also using traditional methods to approach a problem.

Betuel runs an experimental houseware brand named tecomate design. With the mission of creating objects that are great to look at while also providing a functional experience. The name tecomate, originates from Betuel’s time spent in Mexico. From his time there, he learned the many ways his ancestors used the tecomate plant as a multifunctional tool. Tecomates could be used as vessels to carry water, maintain tortillas warm or for dinner ware. He applies this learning into his designs and enjoys creating objects that have elevated purposes.:::936:::152:::0.24545454545454548:::0.4272727272727272:::1:::11:::2016|||"

"1307488628:::53735053:::Anouk von G:::The idea of PlanB1 was born in the mind of a free spirited business woman, Anouk van Gijtenbeek, a nomad and a chameleon.

Born in The Netherlands, but with the World as her home, she started exploring our globe at a young age.
Living in different continents, speaking multiple languages and learning from everyone and every situation she encountered on her path, has given her a great understanding of life, the ability to adapt quickly and a vision to dream without boundaries.

An ongoing adventure started in 2013 in Ghana, West Africa, combined with an unplanned trip to South East Asia, gave life to the idea of PlanB1.
While making both places a home, she saw possibilities of fabricating her idea into a plan. By not relying too much on plan A, but going with the flow and combining creativity and opportunities, it was in 2016, when Anouk started with the manufacturing of PlanB1 clothing in Cambodia. Planb1 operates, upcycles and collaborates now in Ghana, Cambodia and the Netherlands, with many more places and people to follow.

After a few unexpected curveballs there is one thing she knows for sure; life has a way of it’s own and to thrive you need to keep moving, also if that means taking a step back.

"293678600:::112110747:::Michelle Parkins:::Chell Parkins, MFA, has had a career as a dance educator, choreographer, performer and dance scholar spanning over 20 years. She has danced with MADCO in Missouri, Steamroller and Bibliodance in California, Forklift Dance Works in Texas, and alongside Jack Black in the film Bernie. She has collaborated with El Colegio del Cuerpo in Colombia and performed solo works at the Millennium Forum in Northern Ireland and at ZAWP and AZALA in Spain. Since 1995, her choreography has been featured at Dancers’ Footwork and Cell Space in California, in MOMFest, Frontera Fest, Dance Carousel, Coen’s New Works Festival, and Big Range Festival in Texas at at Middle Tennessee Sate University in Tennessee.

As a graduate student, Chell began interweaving technology with dance through investigations of a disembodied versus an embodied choreographic process. Her investigations led her to work with Merce Cunningham's DanceForms, virtual technology, and motion capture while studying the effects of technology on cognitive development. She was invited to be Artist in Residence at AZALA and ZAWP in La Sierra and Bilbao, Spain where she experimented with virtual and corporeal travel. Her performed research involved site specific dance video footage created with the GoPro camera and edited in Final Cut Pro that was then manipulated in live performance using the Microsoft Kinect, Isadora and Delicode. Chell spent three years as the director of dance and drill team at Manor High School in Manor, Texas where she taught students to utilize dance as a vehicle to overcome trauma and build positive communities. Students used technology in the classroom on a daily basis while exploring cultural identity and social issues through dance. While at the high school, she was a consultant and pilot teacher for Dance and Media Communications, a course in Texas public schools that guides students through a process of creating transmedia dance works. Chell continues to write about her experiences in the public school using technology in collaboration with a feminist pedagogy underpinned by tenets of Pedagogy of the Oppressed. Her publications include “Dance Media Collaborations:Engaging At Risk Youth” in the June 2016 issue of Dance Education In Practice and “Dancing on the 50-Yard Line: A Feminist Perspective of Drill Team” on the Women In Dance website.

Chell holds a masters of fine arts degree from The University of Texas at Austin and a bachelors degree in arts and sciences from Washington University in St Louis. She is a full time lecturer in dance at Middle Tennessee State University where she teaches jazz, modern dance, movement for the actor, dance appreciation, theory and practice and dance performance.

"1177605956:::493433619:::Golden Goblin Press:::What is Golden Goblin Press? Golden Goblin Press first appeared as a fictitious company in the story “The Black Stone” by Robert E. Howard, part of the Lovecraft Circle, and also the creator of Conan the Barbarian. Howard’s mythos stories had knife wielding cultists, running gun battles, and two fisted action. Our Golden Goblin Press is a Chaosium licensee, dedicated to producing quality scenarios and articles for Call of Cthulhu. It will honor Howard’s legacy, but will not go overboard with it, nor ignore the contributions of other authors. Many of us here at Golden Goblin Press are also fans of the work of Ramsey Campbell, with his visions of dark, horror infused sensuality and the twisted erotic side of the mythos. Golden Goblin Press will present scenarios with that adult sensibility. Our scenarios will pull no punches—investigators will face deadly peril and moral dilemmas. They may die, or, if they are very careful and very lucky, they might complete an investigation successfully, without entering a single round of combat. But, they will not be left untouched by what they learn. Most Golden Goblin scenarios will begin with actual history. These scenarios will focus on the complex social issues of the periods they are set in. To deny the dark side of history is to refuse to learn the lessons it tries to teach us—and one of those lessons is that the horror humanity perpetrates upon its own kind is more appalling than anything our minds can imagine. Lurking behind all of this will be the Mythos, unknowable, uncaring and ultimately unstoppable. The best investigators can hope for is winning a little more time for mankind.:::1651:::282:::0.09022949735449735:::0.4316587301587302:::8:::30:::2015|||"

"730964202:::1836682034:::Viktor Chernyavskiy:::Viktor Chernyavskiy was born in 1959 in Kharkov city. This is the second largest city of Ukraine. At that time the country was part of the Soviet Union. Viktor has been a Christian almost all his life. He was raised in an underground Christian environment. Viktor’s mother became a Christian in 1963, when Viktor was four years old This was a very difficult time for Christians in the Soviet Union. The Communist Government mobilized public opinion against Christians, against God; and persecuted Christians by official means and through the people. The Christians were the most hated and most despised community group. All protestant Christians were called the Baptists and sectarians. The words “Baptist”, and “sectarian” were very abusive words. Not many people confessed God openly. Viktor`s father left the family after his mother became a Christian. His mother lost not only a husband but the opportunity to have a good job. In spite of prosecution Viktor’s mother always took him to the church meeting, which mainly met in the forest in the warm time of year, from spring to fall. The church was only ten-fifteen people who were the permanent members, out of a population of a million . There were a few other Christian evangelical groups like this one. Viktor grew up in a country where he experienced a lot of stress, prosecution, and humiliation. God always helped him in many ways. God helped Viktor to receive a journalism degree from Kiev Government University, the most prestigious university in the country. This happened in the 80s, when Christians became more free than in previous years. For the next several years Viktor worked as a journalist in some local newspapers in the Kharkov region. On February 2, 1985 Viktor was married to Nataly, who is also a native of Ukraine. They have four boys.:::1814:::312:::0.12367149758454105:::0.2998792270531401:::1:::0:::2018|||"

I'm a full-time writer and part-time hermit. I split my time between journalism, fiction writing, and chopping wood so me and the cat don't freeze. A few years ago, I abandoned city life to get off the grid and back into nature. I moved to the Finger Lakes region of upstate New York, and now live in a 120-square foot cabin, powered by a few solar panels and a wood stove.

Though Emmaline’s musical roots are in violin performance, she recalls spending most of her free time as a young girl singing, writing songs and forming her own local bands. Growing up in a musical family, Emmaline was not only heavily influenced by many different voices of soul and R&B, but also by the voices and instrumentalists of jazz and big band music, thanks to the influence of her father, jazz pianist and arranger, Russ Campbell. These two influences have shaped and molded Emmaline into a modern soul and vintage jazz lovechild whose unique songwriting style and electrifying vocals are unlike any other. After hitting the popular music scene in 2018, Emmaline's social media following skyrocketed to over 300,000 fans across the globe to date. In spring of 2018, Emmaline independently released her first single, “Shy,” (recorded and co-produced by her guitarist, Ryan Mondak) and received placement on top Spotify playlists without the aid of any marketing or promotion companies. Emmaline’s star continued to rise as she began to perform and sell out countless headlining live shows at nationally recognized music venues such as Rockwood Music Hall (New York, NY), The Woodward Theatre (Cincinnati, OH), and Steppenwolf Theatre (Chicago, IL). She also recently performed the jazz standard, “It Don’t Mean a Thing,” with the world famous Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra at Music Hall in Cincinnati.

"1060883347:::851809377:::WE ARE WE WEAR (deleted):::Introducing ‘WE ARE WE WEAR’
There is nothing more frustrating than shopping for swimwear, finding something you love and then finding out that your size is not available.
‘WE ARE WE WEAR’ is a swimwear brand that aims to challenge this by providing a range from XS to XXL – across all styles.
Created by Natalie Paul, previously a designer at Asos, alongside former buyer at Asos Chelsea Williams, the duo have used their experience at one of the biggest online fashion players to build a brand that challenges the unrealistic and unachievable perceptions that the industry puts upon women.
‘We Are We Wear’ believe EVERY woman should feel confident in swimwear. Natalie and Chelsea are advocates for body positivity and want to encourage women to be themselves. The brand, and every collection produced, stands behind this ethos.
With vibrant, striking designs in a range of bold colours ‘We Are We Wear’ understands that swimwear isn't just bought to swim in anymore. Embracing the rise in women buying swimwear for nights out, festivals, layering pieces and even to work out in, the latest ‘We Are We Wear’ Reversible collection includes classic, simple shapes that can be worn in multiple, versatile ways - allowing customers to create their own style, their own way.
‘We Are We Wear’ also champions a more sustainable approach to fashion. ‘The Eco edit is made in Italy from unwanted waste materials such as fishing nets, industrial plastics and fabric scraps and is available across all sizes with flattering styles to compliment all body shapes. ‘We Are We Wear Girls’ can show their love for the planet without compromising on style or fit.
Created by women…for REAL women. Welcome to ‘WE ARE WE WEAR:::1716:::303:::0.202991452991453:::0.4815018315018315:::1:::0:::2019|||"

"445791472:::444112105:::Richard Yim:::Born in Cambodia, Richard spent the first 13 years of his life being cautioned, as all Cambodian children are, about where he could and could not play, and seeing on every street people who were maimed to one degree or another. Richard Yim knows first-hand the danger of land mines: when he was eight, his aunt died after stepping on one. Cambodia has the unfortunate distinction of being one of the most heavily land-mined countries in the world – with an estimated eight to 10 million land mines in the country.
At 13, he moved to Canada, and he later got an engineering degree from the University of Waterloo and founded the Demine Robotics, a company dedicated to detecting and safely neutralizing mines using robotics. Richard’s team is developing a product to make the demining process safer and more efficient by building a machine to excavate and neutralize mines without human supervision.
The challenge is that land mines are easy to make and place (costing as little as $2) but challenging, expensive, and highly dangerous to remove. For Richard, it became a personal mission to figure out a better way to rid the world of land mines.:::1147:::199:::0.09821428571428571:::0.3742857142857142:::1:::0:::2019|||"

I guess I’ll have to give you a bit more. I’ll keep it brief.
Here goes…
I grew up all over the place. Born over seas in Italy then moved to the US when I was two-ish. New York, North Carolina, Texas. All over Texas. It made for a pretty well rounded childhood. You know, the kind where you move to a place just long enough to not make any friends before you move to another place. It was OK, though. I really did make friends, just not the kind that anyone else could see. No no, not imaginary friends, and not ghosts. I just started coming up with stories in my head. My friends were the characters and they would eventually turn into the heroes and villains of my books.
But it took a while…
Several moves, a couple college degrees and a pretty successful consulting career later, and I was finally ready to tell my stories. I spent eight years writing it off and on while holding down my 60-70 hour per week career, and finally in the fall of 2018 made the decision to transition to full-time writing. In fact, as of this writing, my wife and I are selling our beautiful house, and using the equity to live off of while I get these books out. Sounds riskier now that I write it down. I think it’ll work out though.
So now here I am, and here you are. Sharing this moment of our lives together. I hope you like my books. Most importantly, I hope you like them enough to buy a few copies, because it was a pretty good career I left to give this the full go. No pressure…
Seriously though, thanks for stopping by, and please drop me a line or two if you have any thoughts about the books. Or if you want to tell me about your childhood. Whatever you want. I’m here to listen. And charge by the hour.
And if you haven’t signed up for the Newsletter, you should do that as well. And the Facebook page. Don’t forget about the Facebook page. OK that’s enough. It was nice to meet you.
Best,

Lospinoso has been writing on and off his entire life, but just recently finished his first full length book, titled “Bully Complex.” The book follows the author on an emotional journey where he undergoes several transformations. “Bully Complex” is a story of pain, victimization, bullying and ultimately redemption.
	Although, “Bully Complex” is Lospinoso’s crowning achievement, he has been published but mostly in newspapers. Early on, his aspirations were to be a newspaper writer but he lost his way. He has worked so many different jobs and has been a struggling artist. Lospinoso is hoping to make this book the start of the next chapter of his life. There were several defining moments, that changed him for the better. These revelations opened his eyes to the bullying epidemic and made him realize his purpose in life. Now with the launch of “Bully Complex,” the new author would like to add advocate to his new list of accomplishments. He is aiming to help as many kids as possible.

WIBAI Games stands for ""Wouldn't it be awesome if . . .?"" and is Loren's catch phrase when he comes up with ideas for the company.

WIBAI Games ran a successful Kickstarter in 2014 for Transylvania: Curses & Traitors, the company's first attempt at publishing a game. In 2016 WIBAI followed up with a very successful campaign for Pathogenesis, 1st edition.

Jamie has a PhD in Molecular and Cellular Biology and is an Associate Professor of Biology. The idea for Pathogenesis came from her desire to show her students how the immune system functions during a bacterial infection. Jamie is the brains behind Pathogenesis. She matched real biological processes to the game's mechanics.

Loren has a degree in accounting and started his professional career as an auditor for a large CPA firm. Loren then moved into the recruiting industry and has been a business owner for the past 15+ years. Loren's business experience includes accounting, sales, marketing, and daily business management.

"152730994:::1741256969:::Grey Fox Games:::Long before we made games, we played them. I have personally enjoyed playing games for as long as I can remember. From board games to video games to pretty much anything that involved the word ""play"", I have always been attracted to gaming. I still remember the day I decided I hated dice rolling games (it involved an ""impossible"" loss in Castle Risk that haunts me to this day). Being a gamer and enjoying this hobby is what drove me to this business. I've always believed in doing what you love and I can't think of anything I'd rather do than work in this industry. As for why Grey Fox Games needs to run a KS. The answer to that is simple. While we have the funds to design a game (art graphics, play testing, etc), the money to actually manufacture and distribute is another story. Making a game is a very lengthy and costly process and without Kickstarter, we would simply be unable to launch many of our ventures.
My commitment is to never publish a game that I myself would not want to play (I've sort of come to terms with that Castle Risk loss after 30 years, so dice may very well show up in our titles). I truly feel that we have something to offer and we hope that after you've played our games, you'll feel the same way.

"2062382034:::1535011429:::Boris Yu:::A passion for crafting human experiences across transdisciplinary platforms drive my interest in connecting people and their immediate space. Living in a time where change comes at an unprecedented rate, we often overlook the transformative moments in our everyday culture. Supported by design thinking and art principles, I create with the intent of crafting holistic experiences where the intersection of the analog and digital examine the seemingly mundane, thus questioning conventional thought processes that affect the way our communities are shaped. My work anchors itself not in artistic or functionality but in the opportunities for behavioural inquiry. Amidst the chaos our culture is built upon, I place emphasis on the intimate connections we establish and provide moments of retrospect. Previous projects have been exhibited in various notable New York institutions including Parsons, The New School for Design and Razorfish. Most recently, he was one of 20 artists/designers accepted into DesignTO’s annual design week to create a window installation for the festival.

"787409145:::1566128045:::Dawn's Herb Pantry:::Creative type with a love of fuzzies and noms. Love science, and enjoy being silly. I strongly support acceptance and diversity, and despise closed mindedness. I also strongly believe in facts first, opinions much farther to the back of the line.
I have regularly been referred to as a walking encyclopedia, and a well of random knowledge. (Some have used 'useless knowledge', but that doesn't sit well with me, because I don't believe any knowledge is every truly 'useless'.) I come from a long line of innovators and knowledge junkies. I inherited my grandfather's eidetic memory and my grandmother's art talent, as well as her 'gumption' to get stuff 'done'. She is my true hero, as she was the head nurse of her floor, won nurse of the year multiple times, made her own ceramics and painted, raised rabbits for food as well as show, sewed the rabbit pelts into coats and was a well known seamstress, and also made time to be an author and start the ADA chapter in Huntsville, AL. Oh, and she also put herself through nursing school and trained at Dorthea Dix, after kicking grandpa out of the house for a year, while raising 3 daughters. Yeah, that's the person I chose to aspire to take after. Quite the formidable woman, with a heart of gold, a funny and twisted sense of humor, and a laugh that could brighten any room. <3
I am slowly climbing up to her achievement level, but I'd say I'm only about half way there so far. I have quite a ways to go!

In the spirit of living up to my grandmother's gumption and fortitude, I am looking to continue authoring books, as well as get some of my ideas out there for production. This is where others can help. Grandmother knew the value of getting 'backers', as she went around talking to leaders in the community, to finance the ADA chapter in Huntsville. I share her tenacity, of not being afraid of a title, in order to talk to someone. I respect what it took to get a title, but that title does not scare me, there is a difference. I have gone straight up to Base Commanders and faced off over issues of mistreatment of others. Fear does not live in this Dojo!
While some might gasp in shock, there is reasoning to not let a title scare one into automatic acquiescence. It is still just a regular person, just with a title. The title actually translates to increased knowledge, and we should never be afraid to share knowledge... or question it, for that matter. Yes, I learned that straight from her. The flounce after, I got from another remarkable woman, but that's another story, ROFL.
Anyways, earning respect, comes from showing you are not afraid to ask the important questions, as well as showing you won't turn away sheepishly, if asked to lead. Showing you are just as willing to take the reigns, and march forward, earns view of equality in the eyes of other leaders. The mark of a great leader, is one who also remembers to request others to contribute knowledge, instead of leaning solely on his/her own sources. Put that all together, and I find that time after time, I get handed leadership of a group, well before I thought to even ask for it. 40man raids, get made the raid lead, because I know all of the mechanics of the run.
PVP open raid zones, get made the lead, because I know how to do the advancements to get to the end flag.
80man group dev projects, in rooms with VP's, get told to spearhead the group, because I know the in's and out's of SCORM, and found the errors in 2wks, when others spent over 8mths and came up empty handed.
So now, instead of waiting for the next 'event', I am forging ahead, and carving my own path - which I hope to make into a fully functioning manufacturing company, that will employ hundreds, if not thousands. The last person in my ancestry line to successfully pull this level of a business off, would have been my great great great grandfather, and his brothers, when they built a well known oil company out in Oklahoma/Texas area. Grandma came close, and Great Great Grandmother had the only ""General Store"" for miles, but the last truly large business that to this day employs hundreds of people, was the Keck Brothers, who founded Keck Oil, Inc. It's time something that big happened again, and this time, founded on such strong morals that it can last generations and still treat all of the workers fairly. So yes, I am living up to my ancestors, but I also want to go farther than they did. I don't want to just be successful... I also want to build an ethical business. So just making/selling some random product was never going to be good enough, to me. It also had to be something that would make a long lasting impact on our world.

With your help, maybe we can all change the world, into a place that is safe for our children's children!:::4772:::881:::0.10388729487566695:::0.3979556038276968:::2:::1:::2015|||"

In this strange world where people frighteningly referenced lines from TV shows and rallied around professional sports teams, Gideon shielded his inner nerd in the comfort of working as a mechanical, electrical and software engineer at innovative startup companies around the world. In Manhattan, Tel Aviv, Maui and San Diego, he has helped design counterterrorism robots, genetic sequencing machines, rugged training equipment for Olympic athletes, million dollar electronic art installations and Bluetooth enabled security systems.

Gideon's greatest passion is playing hip hop drum beats on paint buckets at farmers markets and boardwalks under the alias, ""Boomtikkabam"". By making high fives and fist bumps more engaging, Noisybands are Gideon's way of sharing a taste of bucket drumming's incredibly social vibes with the rest of the world.

"817424348:::745986374:::brent dewstow-newitt:::The label was established in 2018 as a means to release the back catalogue of renowned Jungle Techno label Underdog Recordings, which ran from 1993-1995. It quickly expanded from beyond the original goal and now reissues sought after, rare and classic records from the Jungle, Rave, Bleep House, Techno and Jungle Techno genres.

The Vinyl Fanatiks aim is to track down and work with the original artists from the early 1990’s, to reissue their music on vinyl only, and to support the record hunters and vinyl diggers from around the world with quality pressings and superb mastering; a way to show respect and share the story of those that created these incredible records.

The vision is not to focus on the obvious artists of that time but to dig a little deeper and find those that came and went but their legacy still holds true to this day. Some of these producers only released one record and vanished soon after but their music still resonates into the 21st century, accumulating new audiences across the globe, far beyond the catchment of the UK pirate radios and muddy fields of 25 years ago. What happened to these artists? Its Vinyl Fanatik’s mission to find out!

Each record captures a moment in time, a vibe that was true and innocent from a period when music was far more synonymous with rebellion and anarchy than today’s finely polished productions and conformist club pop. This music itself bred on the outskirts of society, fuelled by the passion of the rave, its lineage stemming from the Acid House era of 1988. Often produced on minimal equipment, with minimal skills and knowledge, its audio blueprint transcends to new generations, a rawness that no expensive audio plug in could ever create in this present day.

Vinyl Fanatiks wants to pay homage to these young producers who forged the foundations of the multi-million pound EDM scene we have now. Each of these artists has their own tale to tell, their own memories to share. Limited by their own geographical status within the UK, they somehow still all managed to connect and influence each other, years before the internet, mobile phones and social media that we have today. But the music knew no limits and had no boundaries, transcending generations to this day.

Pay respects to the Architekts!:::2289:::394:::0.13644981561648228:::0.349088303671637:::8:::1:::2018|||"

"1393257226:::2095344380:::Calum Graham:::At just 27, Calum Graham has already enjoyed a career that would be the envy of most artists double his age. The Alberta-based guitarist and singer/songwriter has released four acclaimed albums, won major national music competitions, performed at the Olympic Games in both Vancouver and London, racked up some phenomenal views on YouTube, and was most recently named one of the top 30 guitarists in the world under 30 by Acoustic Guitar Magazine. Andy McKee, one of today’s most popular acoustic guitarists, calls Calum “the most promising young guitarist I’ve seen. His command of the guitar is already really impressive!”
Born in British Columbia and raised in High River, Alberta, Graham’s musical journey first took flight when he began playing the guitar at the age of 13. Five years later in the summer of 2010, Graham attended the Canadian Guitar Festival and entered the prestigious Canadian Fingerstyle Guitar Competition. Impressed with his original compositions, the judges awarded Graham with a first place finish; a feat no other teenager has accomplished in the history of the festival. The clip of his winning performance has now generated an incredible 900,000 hits on YouTube.

As Calum Graham’s name continued to grow in Alberta and across Canada for his guitar work and musicianship,, Graham proved that his talent was not limited to his extraordinary ability to play the guitar. In 2011, Graham won the Canada’s Walk of Fame nationwide “A Song For Canada” contest based on his poetic acuteness. His winning poem was used in the song “I’m Here, (A Song For Canada)”. The song was performed by Chantal Kreviazuk and co-written by Graham, Raine Maida(Our Lady Peace) and Stephen Moccio (“I Believe”, 2010 Vancouver Olympics theme song/”Wrecking Ball”, Miley Cyrus)”.

“Calum’s entry resonated strongly among the judges. His poem celebrates the cultural mosaic that is Canada. He has captured the diversity of this country – something that we as a nation are renowned for and proud of.” - Stephan Moccio

In the late winter of 2012, and with two albums already under his belt (Sunny Side Up (2009), Indivisibility (2012), Graham teamed up with iconic Fingerstyle Guitarist Don Ross. The result was the instrumental acoustic duet album titled, “12:34”. Recorded at famed “Metalworks Studios” (Prince, Tina Turner, RUSH, Drake), and released through CandyRat Records (world’s biggest acoustic guitar label), the album featured six originals by Graham, three by Ross, and a cover of OutKast’s hit song, “Hey Ya”.

Not long after the release of “12:34”, Graham saw a loyal following begin to grow and it wasn’t long before his unique sound started to find a wide and appreciative audience.

In November of 2013, Graham released a solo instrumental album titled “Phoenix Rising” (CandyRat Records). The title song has already generated over 1.4 million hits, with other songs also notching impressive numbers. The success of the album enabled Graham to expand his global fanbase and he soon began touring internationally, both on his own and with the likes of Don Ross and Andy McKee.

Graham is currently preparing to record his fifth studio album. Adding an extra dimension to his compositions, the album will introduce Graham’s soulful vocals to his audience for the first time. The album is set to be released in April 2015 and will feature a combination of his exemplary guitar work and smooth vocals punctuated throughout with elements of funk, motown, pop and blues.

With Graham bringing an innovative sound to the industry, it wasn’t long before Canada’s top booking agency, The Feldman Agency, also counted themselves a fan of Graham’s music. So much in fact, that in July 2014, they decided to partner Graham with renowned Canadian producer Gavin Brown (Billy Talent, Metric, The Tragically Hip) on his “Sessions X” series. The series was recorded at Toronto’s Five-Star “Noble Street Studios” and features Graham alongside a number of acclaimed musicians including; Tears For Fears, Feist, Three Days Grace, Metric, and Ron Sexsmith.

The series is expected to be released in the Early part of 2015, along with two singles “Burning Up” and “Tabula Rasa” (CandyRat Records).

At only 27 years old, it’s unquestionable that Calum Graham has enough talent to revolutionize how audiences appreciate music.

Connecting with Nature is very important to me and I do my best to be a good caretaker of this Earth. Many of my pieces are directly influenced by hikes in nature as well as from visions that come to me so, I love recreating plants, Gaia, and wildlife in my work. The biggest spark to begin this incredible journey was actually music. There is so much energy in music. Sound and vibrations make up our world. Words hold so much power, especially when raised in song.

Through my own work and healing with art, I desire to help others grow and start their own healing journey and finding their path of magic in the world.

Through healing myself, I can heal the world.

"560223975:::458863467:::Nelson Caetano:::Nelson Caetano is a multidisciplinary visual artist, whose work ranges from ink and watercolour renderings, oil painted portraits and figurative works, digital illustrations and animation, graphic design and architectural drawings.

Nelson’s passion for drawing and art started long before he can remember. At an early age, comic books and a worn out copy of the works of Michelangelo were his first introduction to the world of art. Those first self-taught lessons came from flipping through the pages of those books. His early fascination with comics became a lifelong affair that continues until this day. After a two-decade absence from illustrating independent comics, Nelson returned to comics in 2016 with “That Little BIG Girl,” a weekly web series promoting a body positive message. Today, he is releasing “The Gathering Place,” a book celebrating the contributions of Toronto-based artists, illustrators and storytellers.

As an arts educator in Toronto, Nelson’s continued enthusiasm for arts education stems from his own ongoing education from various art institutions and from apprenticing with fellow Toronto artists, and from the joy of assisting young artists find their voice.

Born and raised in Toronto, Ontario, Nelson continues to live and work in the city that has inspired much of his stories and art. He does so with his wife and two sons.:::1369:::221:::0.09486363636363636:::0.28235353535353536:::1:::3:::2018|||"

"1422995955:::2065289165:::Thinh Tran:::My name is Thinh Tran from Elk Grove, California. I am the founder and inventor of Transrover, the all-in-one golf cart. I grew up in Vietnam and came to the US when I was 15 to reunite with my father and eldest brother. I came here along with my four brothers, older sister, and mother. Growing up, we didn't have much money to buy anything. From the food we ate, the clothes we wore, to the toys we played with, everything was homemade. We didn't even have running water. Nearby water sources were contaminated. My older brothers and I used to take daily trips to the well across town to carry water on our shoulders for our home use. My humble beginning taught me what it means to work hard, to have determination, and to persevere. When I first came up with the idea for Transrover, I didn't know what I was getting myself into. I soon became a part of me. I first started in my backyard, literally hacking out conceptual prototypes from used strollers parts, broken toys, and random hardware around the house. Over eight years of refining and perfecting, here we are at the edge of production. I am incredibly excited for the future of Transrover and how it could change the way people play golf. It is a golf invention that is long overdue. I hope to have your support to bring this project to life...together. Cheers,

"110928392:::464316850:::Jack M. Freedman:::Jack M. Freedman is not just a publisher from Staten Island, NY. He is also a poet and spoken word artist...from Staten Island, NY. Four books were penned by Jack: One full length book (Serotonin Seas) and three chapbooks (Never Lick the Spoon, Tobias, and Art Therapy 101).

His poems span the globe (literally from New York to Paris). Publications featuring his work include, but are not limited to NYSAI Magazine (New York), POSTblank (Paris), Boston Literary Magazine, Madness Muse (Eugene, OR), Free Lit Magazine (Kingston, ON), Rising Phoenix Review (Boston), and Anti-Heroin Chic (New York). Previously, Jack was the poetry editor of the mental health quarterly, New York City Voices. Recently, his work was featured in an anthology of poetry and prose dedicated to the 2016 US Presidential Election, Nasty Women and Bad Hombres.

Jack started writing and performing poetry at Muddy Cup Open Mic Poetry Night on 9/12/2002 (a year and a day after 9/11). This represents the point where his voice against injustice amplified. He would later host the open mic series from 2005-2007. He continues to perform and feature after a 15-year career as a poet.:::1530:::253:::0.07186662543805401:::0.35963100391671826:::2:::1:::2017|||"

Deduction Card Game, VERTIUM: Shadows of the Complex (SciFi), SHOOTERZ Hockey Card Game, STRIKERZ Soccer Card Game, WORDOPOLIS, and the author of Gold & Sharpe (a novella inspired by Get Adler!). I grew up in beautiful Cape Breton, Nova Scotia. Looking back on my childhood, I can remember inventing games.
At around 9 and 10 years of age, I used to sit down outside and show hockey cards to my beloved dog Spotty. I also made mini baseball games in the dirt with sticks and small pebbles. And best of all, I used to cut out those same hockey cards and play hockey at the kitchen table, with a silver ball for the puck: the foil from my mother's cigarette package.

Fast forward to the late 90's, I got an eye injury at work, which made me photophobic. I couldn't take bright lights and had to wear sunglasses all the time outside. I couldn't watch TV and I couldn't work on computers. The kids and I seemed to go back in time, and we spent many evenings reading, listening to the radio and playing games. Much to my surprise, I began to invent games again ...

I have had lots of help through the years, and I thank God for each person and each invention. I hope you will enjoy the games we bring here. Caper Games - bringing games to life! Enjoy! Randall:::1336:::250:::0.13415637860082305:::0.27132201646090537:::24:::43:::2015|||"

"624062993:::1455455999:::Isaac A. Boatright:::I grew up in a loving family of seven children. My father served in the United States Army, so our family moved around a lot. Looking back, I can see how I had some unusual abilities and talents. My father called me ""the peacemaker"" because my siblings didn't fight when I was around, and I was a popular babysitter with families in the community. I excelled in academia, read widely, and created abundant music, art, writing, and games. From my earliest years I’ve been a mystic, with a vivid inner life. I knew many mysteries and miracles through dreaming and contemplation. I pondered and meditated regularly, testing the limits of my perceptual and cognitive abilities.
Beginning with my teenage years, I went through a number of challenging experiences and spent a couple of decades struggling with depression and drug addiction, until in my early thirties I had a profound spiritual awakening experience that propelled me into a new life. After this spiritual awakening experience I was healed of my addictions and depression. I began to experience health and happiness far beyond anything I'd known before. I devoted myself to daily meditation and developed new perceptual and healing abilities. I began to receive guidance from within and to follow it, which lead me to begin my healing work in 2010.
I love my work: teaching and healing. Real happiness and love come not from who we think we are, but from our internal connection to Source, pure awareness beyond identity and duality. When we find this happiness within, the world inevitably reflects that back to us, and we live not only for ourselves but for the greater good.

"484941843:::726343247:::The Green Revolution Show:::Our show is completely dedicated to learning how to thrive with nature and to empower our viewers with actionable steps to reduce toxins in their own backyards and communities so we are an apolitical show meant to bring people together. We will be using 50% of all of our profits and revenue to plant 10,000 trees in the 10 largest cities in the United States of America as our first major initiative. We just joined forces with Stephen Ritz the Founder of The Green Bronx Machine who has over 1 million views on his TED Talk, to plant trees with him in the Bronx.

The Green Revolution Show is a platform to educate and communicate why now more than ever it is critical to acknowledge that we are one with nature; there is no separation. With our current global climate change crisis and growing population we must act by taking steps toward a zero waste, alternative energy powered, greener future. Our definite chief aim is to empower people to take action to reduce the toxins in their backyards and neighborhoods. We currently film a monthly show in our studio and soon will be filming weekly in front of a live studio audience. We are actively looking for advertisers, investors, and sponsors so in addition to having you attend our show we would love to add your organization as one of our sponsors or partner with you in some sort of fashion!

Rachel Carson author of Silent Spring beautifully elucidates our driving force: “Only within the moment of time represented by the present century has one species - man - acquired significant power to alter the nature of the world.”

Michael Braungart and William McDonough in their masterpiece Cradle to Cradle speak to our mission: “Consider this: all the ants on the planet, taken together, have a biomass greater than that of humans. Ants have been incredibly industrious for millions of years. Yet their productiveness nourishes plants, animals, and soil. Human industry has been in full swing for little over a century, yet it has brought about a decline in almost every ecosystem on the planet. Nature doesn't have a design problem. People do.”:::2109:::366:::0.14013798701298702:::0.3781250000000001:::2:::2:::2013|||"

After graduating from University in Belarus, where I was born and lived until my 23, I moved to the UK and started my education in University of York, in the department of Mathematical Finance. It was my master’s degree, so I spent there about a year and a half. And it was one of the best times of my life. That place gave me a lot of knowledge, experience and training. After York, I came to London to start my career in finance. I got an internship place as a future trader. That was big fun! Of course, it was hard and often stressful, but apart from that I enjoyed it a lot. Then I had a few more professional experiences.:::776:::154:::0.11597222222222224:::0.146875:::1:::0:::2018|||"

Ward, Hartwin, and Koen have known each other for a very long time! The three brothers have been playing together for more than 20 years. Formerly in the forest and in the attic, today on stage. Little has changed in the concept; playfully create their own imaginary world in which no rules apply and it is blissful.

Through the years the brothers managed to create their own sound with their innovative instrumental folk; a musical identity that is hard to link with traditional music from any region, but which still feels familiar to many. The many foreign concerts in the whole of Europe and Canada do not lie.

But Trio Dhoore's music is also appreciated in Flanders. The song ""Endless Dancing"" from their latest album 'Momentum' can be heard regularly on Radio 1. In 2017 the brothers performed main stage during Dranouter Festival and they made their ""entrance"" in the Flemish art centers.

Diatonic accordion, hurdy-gurdy, guitar and electronic effects complement each other seamlessly in a musical adventure where you sit on the edge of your chair.:::1111:::185:::0.1484375:::0.38220993589743596:::1:::1:::2018|||"

"913923658:::476489023:::kasson crooker:::For the last 20 years, Symbion Project has been electronic music endeavor of Kasson Crooker. During that time, he founded the synthpop band Freezepop (www.freezepop.com), was a member of the electronic rock trio Splashdown, wrote a bunch of music for videogames (FreQuency, Amplitude, Rockband, DDR), did a one-off retrosynth project called Larkspur, and is currently in the electropop band The Planets Won’t Let You Sleep Tonight with 3VE_T3A (http://www.facebook.com/theplanetswontletyousleeptonight). The sound of Symbion Project is dark and haunting downtempo and features a large collection of vintage analog synthesizers. Symbion Project is very inspired by the artists Massive Attack, Depeche Mode, Wendy Carlos, Vangelis, Air, and Erik Satie.

The first full length Symbion Project cd “Red” came out in 1997 followed by “Immortal Game” with artwork by Stoltze Design. Not being one to be pinned down stylistically, Symbion Project has continued to embed differing styles of electronic music into its overall aesthetic. Early songs incorporated elements of instrumental techno & trance, along with spastik drum & bass programming. Songs on “Immortal Game” slowed dramatically into hypnotic down-tempo, reminiscent of boards of canada & dj shadow, with haunting synths & vangelis-esque ambient soundscapes. “Immortal Game” also features guest vocalists Melissa R Kaplan of Splashdown/Universal Hall Pass & Leah Callahan, alongside the instrumentals. “Wound Up by God or the Devil,” was released in early 2007 and was the first foray into a different sound for the band. Inspired by the baroque qualities of vintage synth artist Wendy Carlos (A Clockwork Orange, Tron) and Vangelis (Bladerunner), the Wound Up album became the first in a trilogy of instrumental analog synthesizer releases.

2009 saw the release of the 4th studio album “Misery in Soliloquy” which was released on cd in stereo and on dvd in a quad 4channel surround sound format. This album returned to the downtempo sounds of Immortal Game and heavily featured Melissa R Kaplan and Kasson on vocals along with strings arranged and performed by Simon Swarbrick. A followup version cd called “Misery in Soliloquy [Exposed]” has now been released and features the entire album mixed without vocals or drums, allowing the synths, strings, and ambient fx to shine. The most recent release is “Contrapasso” which is a followup to the Wound Up album. This album features a cover of the Dead Can Dance song “Enigma of the Absolute.”:::2501:::403:::0.02434275793650793:::0.39347718253968256:::1:::15:::2011|||"

"1917316337:::1720918132:::Douglas Haines:::Douglas Haines is an Americana/Folk singer/songwriter, blending acoustic guitar melodies with a poet's gift for capturing a story in lyric form.

In his own words: ""My favorite artists ever are James Taylor and Jackson Browne. I love the incredible lyrics and picking intricacies of their guitar work and I love the melodies of their songs. My other favorites are Harry Chapin, Graham Nash, Dan Fogelberg, Karla Bonnoff, David Gates, The Milk Carton Kids, and Gordon Lightfoot.""

First drawn to music by the vocal talents of his father's gospel singing, Douglas began playing the guitar and writing songs at the age of 17. Music became a way of expressing his deepest thoughts and feelings as he blended emotion-filled lyrics with a variety of finger style guitar picking. His simple melodies and soft acoustic sound reflects the influence legendary singer/songwriters mentioned above had on Doug's passion for music.

Doug is a founding member of The Haines Bros. and has entertained on his own since 1980. Throughout his professional career, he has continued to write melodies, play his guitar and sing the emotion-filled songs that have come out of the diary of his life. Today, his original works comprise over 200 songs and his commitment to the story hidden within his music continues to come through to his listeners.:::1330:::219:::0.26625:::0.5141428571428571:::2:::0:::2013|||"

My eyes big my mouth wide open damn near touching the floor! What was I to explore first? as the sun burst through open window shinning on a cigarette lighter on my parents dresser captivated me. With every cell in my body I ran with the object. All I remember next is running from the backyard my tiny 8 year old legs on fire burning away my army fatigued patterned pants flames are as tall as i was.

"1207124393:::2044359653:::Vochlea Music:::Translating musical ideas from our heads into real music is a challenge for any musician or producer.

Expressing and capturing ideas, developing instrumentation, refining sounds and laying down beats using traditional methods and MIDI inputs can be rewarding, but it’s also slow, painstaking and requires lots of technical know-how and experience. When you’ve got an idea for a sound, melody, beat or song, the go-to and most natural way to communicate it is with the voice— our built-in tool for expression. We all sing, hum and record voice memos – but that’s often where that idea ends, never making it into the studio or onto the stage.

But what if you could skip the recording and use the voice to compose directly into your favourite DAW? For the last 3 years, this is exactly what we’ve been working on, and we're launching it to Kickstarter in Spring 2019.:::870:::157:::0.1112037037037037:::0.2749074074074074:::1:::13:::2018|||"

"135239236:::850111244:::Donna Crowder:::She loves pleasing people. It gives her a sort of warmth inside that can’t be described. Donna spent her entire life as mother, entrepreneur, partner and friend helping other people reach their goals and aspirations. A few years ago, she set out on a journey to help fellow frequent travelers while reaching for her own dreams of financial freedom. Having traveled frequently for business, she was frustrated with transporting and packing jewelry which was essential to her for looking and feeling my best when on the road. Inspired by her engineer father, she set out to solve the problem which she assumed was universal for people who traveled with jewelry. Her best friend and daughter Elena, challenged her to reach beyond the comfortable life she knew and bring her ideas to life. The Journey has been educational, exciting, frustrating and satisfying. Her experience in business ownership and project management in a traditionally male dominated field have given her the strength, determination and the organizational skills to overcome the many obstacles along the way. Now, with the support of her family and friends, Delena has become a reality. Her love for traveling and jewelry is evident in this product. She hopes that you love it as much as she does.:::1265:::211:::0.15729166666666664:::0.27534722222222224:::2:::4:::2018|||"

"604675478:::367222894:::Marquina Iliev-Piselli:::I’m Marquina – a mother, wife, digital marketer, breast cancer survivor, competitive air guitarist, insufferable karaoke singer, and all-around-goofball living in Brooklyn, NY.

When I was diagnosed with breast cancer in October 2015, my life stopped. We had been trying for a second child – that dream was dashed. I had recently launched a business – that project was sidelined.

I experienced uncertainty, sadness, anger, and pure fear. That fear caused me to retreat into myself. I didn’t want to talk to anyone about my diagnosis because it was too painful to relive with each retelling. Each time I would muster the courage to discuss what I was going through, I left the interaction feeling depleted and raw. At a certain point, I didn’t want to talk, walk, smile, or leave my bed. I was short-tempered with my husband and son. I felt stalled. Stuck.
Depression loomed like a rain cloud that would not pass …and I sought professional help. I mourned the loss of my old life. How could I escape this cloud of sadness?

I wanted to take my life back. But how could I keep moving when I was paralyzed by fear – a fear that never leaves your side, even after you’re in ‘remission’.
I began to create…

It started small. Drawings, sketches, poems, songs.
These small creative projects brought be one step closer to myself. They were my ‘little triumphs’ over my all-encompassing fear.

I started ‘Share Triumph’ (https://www.facebook.com/ShareTriumph/) to showcase the small steps that lead us on our path back to joy.

My little triumph may not be the same as yours – and that’s okay. We are all on different paths.

As we share our small triumphs we are both encouraging others as much as we encourage ourselves. Sometimes we need a reminder that we should simply start putting one foot in front of the other.

This Kickstarter will fund the survivor stories essay collection 'TOUGH: Women Who Survived Cancer'. Let's get these 40 gut-wrenching, heart-pounding, chemo-brain-fueled tales into the hands of as many survivors as possible: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/604675478/367222894?ref=640130&token=7d113793:::2140:::366:::-0.01803102651316937:::0.27050791470434327:::1:::2:::2018|||"

"1138071349:::1396704006:::DJ Direct Inc:::Our story began by answering a single question; can people improve their homes with quality products sold at low prices? However, in answering that question, it became imperative that we first analyze a critical observation. Since 2012, our team has been primarily selling wholesale construction supply products to large institutions such as schools, hotels, and government agencies. This lasted for three short years, until a staggering void in the online home improvement market came to our attention. We quickly realized that by pivoting our strategy to focus on retail-facing business coupled with wholesale-level prices, we could deliver home products that the everyday homeowner could afford. We started understanding that the home is perhaps one of the most important financial investments you can make. We saw firsthand how preserving a home’s health is critically important, but often infeasible. Steep prices at chain retailers often burn holes in your wallet, preventing you from fixing any issues and causing damaged appliances to fester in your household.

And as we are interested in DJing, we naturally became interested in developing headphones that can be purchased inexpensively despite of high quality. We received some support from experienced Chinese and Korean companies because this product is our first development product. After researching and developing together, we were able to launch the headphone.:::1430:::218:::0.190974025974026:::0.4701010101010102:::1:::66:::2018|||"

Project creator

I was born in Edmonton in 1965 and lived in an apartment above my father’s restaurant until 5 years of age. From the time I was old enough to walk down the back steps to the restaurant, I would sit and watch my father create meals and an atmosphere of laughter and sharing. I knew it would ultimately be the beginning of my life in the Restaurant industry. I worked for my father in the family business until the age of 16. By 19 I was working in restaurants in Jasper, AB. It was in Jasper that I gained great knowledge of the Hospitality & Tourism economy. By the age of 25, I had moved to Banff and opened my first business, a pizza & pasta delivery business, before selling it and moving to Vancouver. It wasn’t long before I determined that I needed to put down roots and open a full service restaurant. So I planned, conceptualized, and opened the “Ouzeri”. Within the first year, the ""Ouzeri"" would be on the lips of food critics in the Northwest and would find itself favorable to many food critics including James Barber, of ""The Urban Peasant"". The Ouzeri won food awards by critics’ and peoples’ choice in many newsprint publications like Northwest Best Places and the Premier Awards of the Vancouver Magazine. After 10 strong years, I sold the ""Ouzeri"" and moved on to work for two award-winning restauranteur icons in the fine dining industry in Vancouver. I managed a fine dining restaurant, and consulted on a few restaurants before moving to Kelowna, the heart of the Okanagan, to further my education in the wine industry. It was here that I saw an incredible opportunity in West Kelowna which had a lack of Mediterranean cuisine or fast casual, modern restaurants. I have spent the last 2 years conceptualizing and planning this new venture and have found and secured the perfect location. I am using my full investment, but with all of the work involved in transforming the current location I could really use your help to solidify its successful launch. I would sincerely appreciate your investment in my vision for a great West Kelowna Mediterranean Restaurant.

I am fully committed to ensuring that you will feel pride in your contribution.



Sincerely,

"137201851:::1048776686:::Imperious:::In 2009 IMPERIOUS was given birth by main composer Sertorius, who started the band originally as a solo project, in which he wanted to fullfill his intention to create music out of historical and/or poetic sources. After he finished the songwriting for the first album, he searched for musicians to record it. During that process he decided to look for band members, not only for helping hands, because he wanted to bring his music to the stage also.

In Kalmesh (git), Iluaar (Git) and Linchre (Drums), who had known themselves through other projects already, he found a well matching team. Sertorius took the bass and vocal position.

Together they shaped the songs by bringing in individual influences, rearranged and finally recorded them.
The first album “Varus” was released in April 2009 through Twilight Distribution worldwide.

Underground club shows, gigs at established festivals like “Ragnarök Festival” and “Walpurgis Metal Days”, motivating album and live reviews followed, but IMPERIOUS couldn’t manage it to get any further than that due to reasons of time and individual personal circumstances. Furthermore their label and distributor had to give up their business, so the band stood there empty-handed.
They did some regional shows yet, however they couldn’t tie in with the first successes.

But that was not the end.
Perhaps IMPERIOUS was wounded, but not dead.

After they removed all barriers and problems which stood in their way, IMPERIOUS started with regained powers and passion a challenging new project: Translating Homer’s Odyssey into a musical concept.

3 years of songwriting, recording and also line-up changes (drummer Linchre left the band due to creative reasons) went by, in which the band reached a new level of motivation, creativity and effectivity.

Forged by Markus Stock (The Vision Bleak, Empyrium) at the famous Klangschmiede Studio E, IMPERIOUS‘ new masterpiece now comprises 2 full-length albums telling the story of Odysseus and his epic journey from the conquered shores of Ilion to his beloveth homeland Ithaca.
The first part of their musical creation called “Tales Of Woe – The Journey Of Odysseus – Part I: From Ilion To Hades” was released in May 2015. The second part “Tales Of Woe – The Journey Of Odysseus – Part II: From Hades To Ithaca” followed 1 year later.

"378044010:::2026328875:::Digital Amplifier Company:::Digital Amplifier Company was founded in 1996 after several years of developing switching amplifiers for audio. Our goal was development of new high performance amp technology. One of our first products was a 6-channel digital audio amp for PCs that fit into a drive bay slot and ran from the disk drive power supply. This was about the same time DVD players hit the market.
We have designed both analog and digital input audio amps with analog and digital modulation for just about every practical power level — headphone amps to multi-thousand watt live performance concert amps. We have designed open loop, closed loop, and even hybrid loop systems.
We worked with Harris Semiconductor to evaluate use of their driver chips in the first Class-D auto (car) amplifiers to hit the market in the early 1990s. We developed innovative modulation techniques, circuit topologies, and DSP algorithms for use in digital amplifiers. Licensing clients of our older technologies include ST Microsystems and Peavey Electronics. Other licensees, covered under non-disclosure agreements, use our technology in commercial and installed sound systems.
Our objective several years ago was to license our amplifier core to semiconductor companies. This opened up an opportunity to develop custom ultra-high-end modules for an amp manufacturer which led to development of a 2-channel evaluation platform.
Our patented technology has been improved through use in various applications. Our most important application by far has been premium 2-channel audio. This forced us to concentrate on ultimate sound quality as our goal. We designed our new platform to drive difficult speakers (such as electrostatic) with control and authority. We designed for ultra-precise low level detail for that super important “first watt”. We designed-in tons of headroom for powerful transient delivery. We designed for extremely low noise so the music glides atop a black background.
Eventually, we decided to manufacturer our own finished product, the DAC4800A. This amp was developed entirely in-house, NOT using any off-the-shelf amplifier modules.

"1501836929:::1683590875:::Tom Deacon:::Hello my name is Tom Deacon (T.J.) . I was born and raised in Westchester County in the lower Hudson Valley. For starters, I love the outdoors. I have spent the majority of my free time hiking, kayaking, road tripping, taking pictures, and trying to reach every corner of the U.S. . I finally did so in 2012 after driving from New York to Alaska, and on a separate trip traveling to Hawaii.

Looking back, I realize how fortunate I have been, and have begun to think seriously about how to further pursue my passion of being outdoors, live a healthier lifestyle, and give back to the community that has treated me so well. That led me to start Fable. To build a sustainable farm growing high quality produce that’s delicious and healthy for our body, and also treats the planet with the care and respect it deserves.

For the past few years I have been growing culinary herbs and leafy greens outdoors, and more recently started to grow indoors as well. Using modern technological advancements such as Vertical Farming, LED Lighting, Hydroponics, and Wireless Networking, I’m confident that we can bring farming into the 21st century.

I run a non-profit bird rescue here in Texas, and when I'm not working with animals I create art. I'm the creator of Happy Dragons, cute little whimsical sculptures that where able to jump from my imagination and take flight right here on Kickstarter. Happy Dragons have now been licensed and will soaring into stores soon. I've become best know for my whimsical fantasy artwork of dragons & other mythical creatures but I also enjoy creating pet and wildlife artwork. I worked for years as the owner of a non-profit animals rescue, a zookeeper, a vet tech & a wildlife rehabber. So you can imagine I have a real connection to animals. I use my love for animals to create my fantasy art & base a lot of my creatures off my pets. I studied fine art/sculpting/illustration at the Academy of Art University in San Francisco, but I still considers myself largely a self-taught artist, and I'm always trying to challenge myself to do new things.:::1019:::183:::0.2056377264710598:::0.4636934824434824:::9:::68:::2012|||"

By combining forward thinking creativity, progressive techniques and natural musicality, Skellenger displays a uniquely identifiable sound. Born and raised in Denver, CO., Matt has been composing, performing, and recording in the Front Range for 25 years. In 2002, he earned a B. A. in Music from Metropolitan State College of Denver where he studied with internationally renowned trumpeter Ron Miles. Skellenger's fierce dedication to the electric bass led him to attend Steve Bailey and Victor Wooten's Bass At the Beach Workshop in 2004, as well as five of Victor Wooten's Bass Nature Camps from 2004-2010. There he had first hand experience studying with world class musicians including Victor Wooten, Steve Bailey and Chuck Rainey who are full time instructors at the camps and some of the most influential musicians to ever play the electric bass. At the 2005 BNC, Skellenger was awarded one of two scholarships to attend The Bass Collective in NYC for a week long intensive course. The versatility of Matt's playing can be heard on music ranging from solo bass, jazz sextet and modern rock power trio to folk, Americana, funk, blues and pop groups.

Previously, he already has gathered extensive experience in the field of roleplaying, first, as an employee in a games store, then working at a wholesaler and finally, as publishing director at Ulisses Spiele.

The first games published by Uhrwerk were the German versions of Hollow Earth Expedition and Deadlands Classic in 2009 as well as the license for the western continent Myranor for The Dark Eye. In the following years, Uhrwerk also published further games with great success, among them more and more German self-prodcutions like Malmsturm, Contact or Dungeonslayers. But they also continued extending the publisher‘s list with translations of English games such as Numenera and Achtung! Cthulhu.

Since 2013, Uhrwerk Verlag (under the label Clockwork Publishing) also captures the English-speaking market. With a successful kickstarter for a translation of the German version of Space:1889, the English version of the game was financed. At the same time, Uhrwerk Verlag focuses mainly on the production of Splittermond, its own German fantasy roleplaying game. Today, about a dozen employees are permanently emplyoed at Uhrwerk Verlag. On average, three to four roleplaying publications are issued per month.

"2120447005:::1194437308:::Yotam Silberstein:::Tel-Aviv native Yotam Silberstein began playing guitar at age 10. This young prodigy was soon invited to perform with many of the nation’s top jazz musicians. By the age of 21, Silberstein has won the coveted “Israeli Jazz Player of The Year” title. Soon after, he performed at Italy’s renowned Umbria Jazz Festival, released a critically acclaimed debut album and set out on an extensive tour of Europe and the Middle East.
Upon receiving a scholarship to the prestigious New School, Yotam Silberstein moved to New York in 2005. Praise continued to pour in as a finalist in the 2005 Thelonious Monk International Jazz Guitar Competition with one critic noting, “Yotam’s tones are exquisitely old school but his playing fresh, fiery and bursting with joyful exuberance, and musically he is one heavy cat.” Jazz Times noted, “Since his arrival in New York in 2005, Israeli guitarist Yotam Silberstein has made an impact on the scene with his precision bebop lines and fleet fingered improvisation. All About Jazz summed up his 2009 release, “Next Page” as “unadorned hollow-body guitar work freely invites comparison to releases from the heyday of Blue Note Records. He isn’t piggy backing on memories. He’s forging his own path with skills and style.”

As artistically gifted as he is technically proficient, Silberstein is featured on a wide variety of critically acclaimed releases including “Resonance” and “Brasil” on the Jazz Legacy Productions label and Monty Alexander’s Grammy-nominated “Harlem-Kingston Express Live!”

In just six years since arriving in the Big Apple, internationally acclaimed Yotam Silberstein has earned his place among the jazz elite by collaborating with such luminaries as James Moody, The Heath Brothers, Paquito D’ Rivera, Monty Alexander, Roy Hargrove, and the Dizzy Gillespie Alumni All-Stars.
This versatile guitarist’s wheelhouse runs the sonic spectrum from the straight ahead to Brazilian, world music, blues and bebop. Silberstein’s showmanship wowed the Kennedy Center’s 2011 production, “Ella!” which featured Dee Dee Bridgewater, Al Jarreau, Dr. Billy Taylor and Janis Siegel. His performance earned him a return invitation for a special appearance at the KC Jazz Club.

"792216397:::2067846229:::Dark Garden:::I started Dark Garden in 1989 - it was my dream to make people feel beautiful, no matter what size they were. I’m a horizontally challenged lady myself, a little shorter and a bit curvier than anyone depicted in any fashion magazine. The fashion industry never felt welcoming to me, nor did any number of boutiques I visited, but fabric stores with all of their gorgeous materials and exciting pattern books were an enchanting land of imagination and potential. While dreaming with a pattern book one day I decided I wanted to make gorgeous and high quality clothes - and not just for myself. From that day forward I focused everything towards sewing and design. I left high school early and started studying fashion history, pattern drafting and clothing construction. To support myself and my fabric needs I got a job in a fabric store. Here, I met people who were like me - they felt more welcome in fabric stores than clothing boutiques and wanted garments made specifically for them. One thing led to another and pretty soon Dark Garden was born. I made dresses, wedding gowns, hats, historical costumes, dance costumes and even a few slip covers. I started making corsets to go under the historical costumes I was creating. Soon, I had too much work to do by myself and I started working one of my incredibly talented friends, Monique Motil. She is a sculptor among many things and we dove into the world of corsets, shaping every person that came our way, discovering what made a good corset, and what made a great corset. And that was it - corsets had me by the heart strings. People feel sexy, and beautiful and in fact, more like their inner picture of themselves when they’re wearing a good corset, and there is nothing more satisfying to me than hearing a person sigh with pleasure, saying “I’ve never felt so beautiful."":::1833:::325:::0.2186111111111111:::0.42916666666666664:::2:::0:::2012|||"

"1044930636:::853584281:::Michelle Delacre:::My Father was an artist and art has always held an important place in my life. As a high school student it was suggested to my parents, by my art teachers that I follow a career in that field and go to the Beaux-Arts in Paris. Being 18 at the time, and all knowledgeable, I did the next best thing. I met an American, fell in love, got married came to the States, had three children, and life took over.
Now that the children are gone and at the urging of my husband, I finally have the opportunity to get back to do something that I enjoy.
Another factor that prompted me to give time to this pursuit was a health issue. A few years ago I was diagnosed with A-Fib, Atrial Fibrillation. For three years, I was plagued with this illness rather severely and was about to have a surgical procedure to correct the condition. Just at that time it began to subside. Since then the problem has not reoccurred and I feel very fortunate. During the time of this illness, I came to realize I was not immortal after all and maybe it was time to do something more creative and enjoyable. Thank you for your attention to my project, I do appreciate all support I get.

"32123556:::1614830512:::Shore Projects:::Shore Projects is a watch brand inspired by the beauty and fun of the British seaside. Started by a group of friends who one day noticed that none of them actually wore watches, our ambition was simply to create a timeless, quality product that could be worn every day.

All the watches are influenced by vintage designs, combined with strong modern day build quality. Using precision manufacturing processes this allows the watches to withstand the demands of everyday living. They are made with stainless steel cases and have crystal sapphire glass. The leather on the straps is of the finest quality sourced from Italy and all are waterproofed to 100m which means they are designed for swimming in the sea.

One of the most exciting features of the watches is the innovative strap mechanism that makes it easy to swap straps on a daily basis, so the look of the watch can change in just a few seconds. The idea is to create as many colours, styles and patterns as possible so that you never get bored wearing the same strap over and over again.

We set out to ensure that we bring out our first Automatic watch with a bang.

Project 4 has been 2 years in the making; we've gone through many prototypes, tweaking the colours and designs to make this product just how it is meant to be. The manufacturer has the completed prototypes at the ready for mass production.

Thanks so much for the support,

REPROBATES began as scribbles on the pages of a notebook ,whilst travelling in 2017, but it was a pipe dream that I might someday hold a tangible copy.

It wasn't until a tradition on NYE 2018 whereby a bottle of champagne is drank and then people write their resolutions on a piece of paper and put them in the bottle only to smash it open 12 months later and hold one another accountable to their respective goals. My companions didn't know then, but my resolution was 'Boardgame', and the 'game was afoot'. I've been fortunate enough to have enjoyed some success in horse racing, although those involved will say there's no such thing as luck only the ability to pick the right team for a project.

This ""Luck"" in getting the right team together followed me to the Reprobates project when I happened on Tom and Billy from BILLO Studios, over a couple of lemonades, without whose creative direction, expertise, and comedic input this would still only be scribbles in some forgotten Notebook.

We'll hopefully be able to sign off future 'About us' sections with 'Creators of a renowned card game, Reprobates', but for now let's just say 'Amateur Reprobates, Aspiring inventors'. While you won't be able to help us bring a ""Boardgame"" to you in 2019 as per my champagne promise, you can support our X-rated CARD GAME this Christmas.

Hi, my name is Bryan Crown and I am the creator of Die Fly! I have been creating games since I was a wee lad. One thing that has always held me back from just having fun ideas to actually creating a product was the artwork. I am a middle school teacher so I've never had extra funds to pay for an artist. I decided to create a game where I could do my own art (even if it looked a little goofy). I've never been a good artist, but I tell my students all the time to have a growth mindset and to persevere through failures. It has been a lot of hard work, but I've truly enjoyed creating this game, and I'm proud of what I have created. I have a whole bunch of different ideas and Die Fly! is just the tip of the iceberg. Thank you for your support, as this will be the beginning of a grand adventure!:::929:::184:::0.2587673611111111:::0.3890624999999999:::2:::2:::2017|||"

"1853945373:::460617356:::Shadi Toloui-Wallace:::Born to an Iranian mother and Australian father, in Sydney, Australia, Shadi spent her early childhood on the banks of the Mediterranean in northern Israel. At the age of nine, her family relocated to Brisbane, Australia. A language and cultural barrier prevented Shadi from instantly fitting in, so she turned to music for comfort and community. Throughout her life, Shadi has experimented extensively with various artistic mediums, exploring ways in which she could contribute to her community. Always looking to the younger generation for inspiration, she saw a gap in the market for uplifting songs that would “impress upon the consciousness of the young the profound concepts enshrined in the Baha'i teachings” (Universal House of Justice, 2011). At the age of 15 she began to put her own simple melodies to the writings and stories of the Baha’i Faith and would regularly share them with her community.

At the age of 18, Shadi returned to her childhood home of Haifa, Israel, to participate in a year of service at the Baha’i World Centre. There, she wrote many songs and melodies that would later be featured on her debut album, Leather Bound Book.

Upon her return to Brisbane, she completed a BA in Mass Communications in 2010, from the Queensland University of Technology. But, just like her parents, Shadi continued to seek adventure. Soon after graduating university Shadi relocated to Vancouver, Canada, a despite many travels this has been her home base ever since. For almost a decade Shadi has been the recipient of unwavering support from family and friends around the world, which has lead to the successful release of three internationally acclaimed albums - Leather Bound Book (2009), Verdant Isle (2011) and most recently, Daughters of the Kingdom (2016). These records featured collaborations with various family members, most notably with her mother, Shidan. In 2012 Shidan, released her first debut solo album Phoenix of Love, which Shadi also collaborated on. All records were inspired by the writings and stories of the Baha’i Faith.

Since the release of Leather Bound Book in 2009, Shadi has toured her music throughout Australasia, North America, South America, and Western Europe. Drawing inspiration from her spiritual beliefs, honest reflections, creative collaborations, travels and service opportunities, Shadi’s music transcends cultures, languages and generations, and continues speak to the hearts and minds of all who hear it.

Shadi is currently working on her fourth Baha’i inspired album. A mixture of old and new collaborations with her mother Shidan, the album will feature their unique ability to blend the East and West through soul stirring melodies in English, Farsi and Arabic, set to the Baha’i writings. They will be launching a Kickstarter campaign in the coming months to raise necessary funds to produce their first collaborative album. For more information about their current project check out their Kickstarter and video.:::2986:::487:::0.1272516835016835:::0.3177244712958999:::2:::5:::2015|||"

"1542207112:::1114539533:::James Azrael:::Born on April 12th, 1978 to Roque ""Rocky"" (Father) and Rolee' (Mother) [having proud heritage and origins within the Sioux Nation, and Ooglala Tribe], James Azrael was destined to enter the music industry. At the age of six, ""The Rev,"" as he's often referred to now, began his musical prowess with the piano, but promptly moved on to become the solo upright bass-player for his school's orchestra at the age of nine. By the time junior high rolled around, much to the chagrin of his parents, James was drawn to the electric guitar, and began his new journey, his calling, in 1991. In 1992, James wrote his first song, ""Welcome To Hell,"" which was recorded for the first time, in a professional studio, in 1996. It took another 7-years to become James' vision he had 11-years prior. It was released in 2003 on Court Jester's debut album, ""GINA"" [Cellar Records]. For the last thirteen years, James has composed (music & lyrics) and arranged nearly 95% of Court Jester's published library of songs; and lest we not forget...Court Jester's rhythm/lead guitarist. And in 2003, they released their debut album (encompassing a decade of songs James had written), ""Gina,"" drew critical acclaim for their efforts and had put the band on the map. Their sophomore album, ""Stangeland"" was released in January 2006 and featured Dizzy Reed of Guns N' Roses on piano and Hammond C2 Organ. The album quickly gained popularity, with the help of the notorious Howie Rosen, and landed the group two hit singles -""Hollywood Girl"" and ""Needless to Say"" respectively - which ranked highly among two separate formats & audience demographics (Rock & Adult Contemporary). In addition to his successful musical career, James has also dabbled into the Film/TV Industry. James appeared in the a 2003 major network & cable commercial campaign for WAHL, Inc. alongside UFC Heavyweight Champion, Andrei Arlovski; James currently endorses WAHL, Inc.'s line of Beard Trimmers. He was producer for the award-winning 2007 feature film ""Farewell Darkness (winner of such prestigious awards as: 'Best Feature Film' at the Drake International (Italy) and Del Ray Beach Film Festivals, respectively. James is no stranger to the lens' eye either. You may spot him in such titles: ""The Birthday Card,"" ""Common Senses,"" ""The Break-Up,"" ""Roscoe Village,"" and more. Additionally, James is making a name for himself as a composer since his debut for the highly respected, revered and award-winning 2006 short-film ""Soldier;"" Film Threat Magazine wrote, ""...['Soldier'] is the second best unseen movie of 2006!"" Some may still remember James from his days as a Chicagoland radio (1992-2001); working alongside such great talents as Erich ""Mancow"" Muller, Danny Bonaduce, Lou Brutus and more. He continues to do work as a voice-over artist, most recently hired to do a ""book-on-CD"" of the children's book, ""The True Story of the 3 Little Pigs!,"" (Jon Scieszka) for the Illinois School Library Media Association. James provided all the character voices and narration, a score, spfx, even that infamous ""turn-the-page"" chime! James does all his own production, from concept to mastering. James has a Bachelor's of Fine Arts Degree in Radio Broadcast Communications and a Masters of Teaching Degree in Education/K-9 with an endorsement for Public Speaking.

Currently, with Court Jester on hiatus, James is pursuing new avenues, experimenting, and taking on projects of all kinds. James' solo work is available via Digital Distribution on over 40 locations, including: Amazon, iTunes, Rhapsody, Napster, LimeWire, and many more; and an ""iPhone Exclusive"" ring-tone.:::3618:::583:::0.16072649044795786:::0.3991985068072024:::4:::56:::2011|||"

"976748766:::2022154046:::Sumeru:::A band known for their passionately fierce and ear crushing live shows, Sumeru’s onstage energy is exerted with an almost fanatical dedication that it verges on a cult-like rite of sonic exorcism and visceral upheaval. Add in the long-crafted musicianship of each member of this Sydney 5 piece, their ability to peel subconscious layers off of their audiences was apparent since their inception in 2009. Having shared the stage with foreign imports and domestic legends such YOB, Church of Misery, Torche, Nick Oliveri (back up band & support), Windhand, Nails, Blood Duster, Beastwars, IEXIST and Lo! Sumeru now stand firmly grounded in the Australian heavy music underground as a defining force of pure riff fury and indomitable low-end groove.

Sumeru’s second album, ‘Summon Destroyer’ is out now.

"1313324524:::1974201660:::Nicholas Edward Werner-Matavka:::I am a Renaissance man with a large number of widely varied hobbies and interests. As well as writing books (both fiction and non-fiction), I have dabbled in various aspects of Information and Communication Technology, including Internet protocol standardisation (IETF RFC's). The project most relevant to my current work with Hermes, however, is WireShare, which was formerly known as LimeWire.

When I learned, in January of 2012, that LimeWire was going out of business thanks to a court injunction, and especially considering that somebody had mirrored the source of the most recent version elsewhere, I decided that the copious man-hours of work that had gone into writing it had to be preserved, no matter what. While the source code was freely licensed under the GNU GPL, the name was copyright to a corporation that was enjoined from operating—and I thus set about changing it and making WireShare, as the program was now named, the best Gnutella client it could possibly be.

I was not a programmer in those heady days of 2012, nor am I one now. This is, first and foremost, a collaborative effort, governed by a sprawling text file known as ""the Org chart""; my skills are limited to Help file authoring, technical writing, and team leadership (especially in the early stages of a project). I therefore owe my eternal thanks to the invaluable contributions of Jeff Prickett, Pete Maclean, Soren Thygesen, and others; it would not be possible without you.:::1467:::244:::0.1349404761904762:::0.4408779761904762:::2:::0:::2018|||"

"978268910:::1970157328:::Jesse Montero & Jennifer Merritt:::I have never known if anything would work or not by not trying it for myself.

By not fearing failure, knowing that was the worst possible outcome and that anything better then that was a success and the outcome was then putty in my hands. This was up to my dedication since I loathe my own personal failure.

As a child I always loved creating with my hands. I was allowed opportunities to use trade tools starting at 11 unsupervised, my family had a garage large enough to afford me space to do so, and I haven't stopped since. Working in construction at the same time and under a civil engineer and grandfather who showed me how loads and levers work. Always tackiling things in an effective manner and repurposing for the sake of a bottom line without sacrificing saftey or integrity. Those perspectives and many others along the way opened my eyes to the simplicity inside of anything complex, or how it was made and what it can become.

I made way into jobs that did custom work in houses and mansions alike, same principals larger or basic projects deserving of the same attention and detail as the last. In my 20+ years of work history I have managed to learn a lot. This includes but is not limited to: custom fireplace design; installation and service/ restoration, remodels and new construction, heavy equipment and maintence of them, roughneck, welder/fabricator, Internet networking and tower installations, arborist- tree climber, cement finishing, owner and operator of a consignment and pawn shop for 3 years, Ebay and Amazon sales and more. After a divorce I was in a position I had to rebuild. Building us to the present.

In December 2016, Jen had surgery and nerve damage came of it taking her out of the medical feild. I was working as a blacksmith fabricator here in Reno but put in a position of family duties and after surgery care for her and our daughter, leaving me in less than desirable place with my employer. I have never been one to give up or not move forward, so here we are, ready to let a need of self employment lead to the pursuit of our love of blacksmith art and repurposing for profit and decor.

I have no doubts in my abilities to deliver the same quality item that hangs above our family on game night and days my daughter plays at home, into your lives as well. As to emails and questions or even meeting us for a cup of up at a coffee joint here in Reno, we would welcome aspiring smithies and those with a curiosity into our lives, Jen and myself will handle them asap. Custom options and requests are welcomed and shipping during my e-bay days are fresh and ready to get them to you in good time & same as the day it was created condition.

"1602622807:::326995847:::Hannah Hebl:::Hannah grew up in Eau Claire, Wi. recording and performing with her sisters and father (mom was the live sound tech!) as The Hebl Family Singers. She left Eau Caire at 14 to study 4 years of high school at Phillips Exeter Academy, a boarding school in a small coastal town in New Hampshire. During that time of deep homesickness, some heavy music was coming out of Eau Claire, and the Midwest in general. Bon Iver's For Emma felt like a healing care package, like the boxes that would arrive at Camp Mantiou, full of peanut butter cookies. That album, among others, kept her musical practice afloat, amidst pressures to focus on myriad other prestigious academic pursuits. It allowed her peers from global backgrounds to get a glimpse into the sound of a landscape that shaped my sensitivities as an artist. Post-high school, Hannah did a short stint at the San Francisco Art Institute (Formerly California School of Fine Arts) studying New Genres (performance and video art). Finding the degree too narrow, she came back home and studied at UW-Eau Claire, going for a Dance Minor and Liberal Studies Major entitled ""Performance and the Body"" while playing in bands like Adelyn Rose and the Island of Dr. Lee. Then another short stint in Montreal studying Contemporary Dance, she found new inroads to the performing body and how one reaches a performance potential. Hannah is coming into her own as a musician and performing artist in Minneapolis. She has performed as Hemma for 2 years and has been writing and performing original songs for over a decade. The overwhelmingly positive forces of Addie Strei, Leo Strei, Jaime Hansen, Neil Sipress and Davy Sumner in the early days at April Base, are testament to the saturation of generous passion that Eau Claire boasts.:::1770:::302:::0.13660443722943721:::0.4073674242424242:::1:::1:::2017|||"

What was the best part of my activity became also the most frustrating : it was interesting and challenging to design new pieces, a bit less to reproduce them several times. On top of this frustration was the lack of time I had to produce sufficiently to respond my customers requests.
It’s quite naturally that I thought 3D printing would solve this dilemma : allow me to design new pieces and let the wargamers /diorama builders print exactly what they need.:::929:::162:::0.3201388888888889:::0.4777777777777778:::1:::4:::2018|||"

"489303010:::389307261:::SC Louis:::I am proudly the embodiment of the American Dream. Born in the Bahamas to Haitian parents, I arrived in the US at age four. I grew up in Miami, number seven of eight children. What was lacking in material riches was more than made up for by the love that surrounded me and the example set for me by my incredibly industrious mother.

As a child, I was drawn to the arts: drawing, painting, photography, etc.. and I loved working with my hands. This early love led me to a Bachelor of Fine Arts from Syracuse University. After graduation, I moved to New York City where I was instantly inspired by the strong design culture and people’s use of fashion to express them selves. I began to sense my calling. My journey with design began at FIT and my talents landed me at one of America’s top luxury leather goods brands. I spent twelve years in the luxury space developing deep expertise in design, materials, construction, understanding consumer desires, and creating a strong brand DNA.

I started the KENETTE brand because I wanted to leave the corporate world of big fashion to start something more original. I want to focus less on chasing trends and margins and more on creating beautiful, AFFORDABLE luxury goods that will enhance and enrich people's lives.:::1265:::226:::0.2863688973063973:::0.39769570707070706:::6:::2:::2013|||"

She’s worked with Tony Bennett, Lyle Lovett, the Squirrel Nut Zippers, the Avett Brothers, and proto pop-punk hero Chuck Prophet. But Ms. Bassett would have won the spelling bee in high school if she’d been given the word sultry to piece together. “No, I’m definitely not scared of tight dresses,” she says, laughing. With her fourth disc, The Goodbye Party, Martha explores longing, anger, loss and love. The songs are heartbroken and wistfully triumphant. “We’re noisier, that’s for sure. Maybe they’re louder songs for a confused country. It’s get-it-wiggling music.” If the hurricane season is as long as predicted in 2011, we’ll hit the 13th letter of the alphabet for named storms… M.

Their lyrical and musical concept deals with the Celtic mythology and stands in close collaboration with the Belgian artist Kris Verwimp, the creative head for the lyrical concept and artwork.

After 22 years of bandhistory and 11 studio albums, SuidAkrA has become a flagship in the German metal scene. In more than 500 shows, the band constantly played tours around the globe. They played numerous European tours, 5 North American tours as well as in South America, China and India. After a festival in the Indian metropolis, Bangalore in 2012, Arkadius Antonik spent a week on the behalf of the German Goethe institute to support regional musical projects. With their 3rd Indian tour in 2014 SuidAkrA became the first Metal band ever that performed shows in 6 different cities in India. This was accompanied by a large public and media interest, such as the german station ZDF that broadcasted a Suidakra tour documentary in ther show called „Aspekte“.

SuidAkrA is signed by the label AFM Records since 2011. The band has released their 13th studioalbum called „Cimbric Yarns"" in November 2018. The album (like the previous one ""Realms Of Odoric"" as well) is based on an artwork / soundtrack project which was started by Kris Verwimp and Arkadius Antonik in May 2013.

Through my unique job I've been privileged to have a rare reintroduction to Caribbean culture as a whole rather than as singular islands, as well as the desire to hone my technical abilities and craft as a story teller further.

"1680537640:::1949083679:::Jeff Cornelius:::Hello! My name is Jeff Cornelius. I have been a freelance artist for going on 25 years. My background includes time at Minneapolis. College of Art & Design and Art Institute Online-Univ. of Pittsburgh. Painting, drawing and generally being visually creative was always a primary part of my life and who I am.

Running art projects on Kickstarter for almost three years now has definitely provided motivation and inspiration. I am so grateful for all my backers and the support they have lent. The challenges presented have given me new directions and fresh ideas.

My last four projects; Ethereal Cats Greeting Cards, Flights of Creativity-Commissions, For the Love of Flowers - Commissions and Ballpoint Pen Tile Image Wildlife Calendar explored some new areas for me, providing additional avenues to follow. This current project, Choice of Subject Commissions Created by Jeff Cornelius, is meant to give my backers freedom to choose what I would create for them, maybe to make contact with some new backers to give me new challenges.

And please, if you have any thoughts on a project that you would like to see, let me know. It is my desire to connect as well as I can with those who appreciate and support my artwork.

Watercolor is something I've worked with since I was 5 years old and gives me options that I don't have with ballpoint pen, or even acrylic. The spontaneity and freshness is exciting to me since even I don't completely know what the end product will turn out to be, though I have a rough idea, I just trust my muse and paint.
Acrylics give a more solid, specific, controlled outcome and gives me the option of making any changes I need to make. It's not as spontaneous as watercolor, but can give a stronger end result.
Pastel for me combines characteristics of painting and drawing, giving me the control of drawing with the color and effects of painting. Oftentimes I am most comfortable with pastels. Around 15 years ago I began having trouble with my eyesight. The problem turned out to be cataracts and I had surgery to get lens implants, one eye at a time. The trouble came when my retina detached after each lens implant operation. This required retina surgery, more involved than lens implants. My sight in my right eye was almost lost and recovery from the retina surgery took vision away in that eye for over a month. My left eye wasn't as bad and recovery was easier. Then about 18 months later, the lens in my left eye slipped and another implant operation was needed. This time my retina held.This was quite a scare for an artist and since then I have tried to give more time to creating. I am thankful for any support I can get, and am energized so much by people who appreciate what I do. For the last 14 years, my vision has stayed at 20/30, 20/40 with no problems other than a reduced peripheral capacity and some blind spots due to the retina operations. I am so very thankful for the doctors and the technology that has made it possible for me to continue creating as a visual artist. Every new work is a real victory! Wildlife, landscape and animals are my main subjects of interest, but I also enjoy doing flowers, cars, and houses. Mediums I enjoy include,ballpoint pen, pencil, pastel, china marker, colored pencil, watercolor and acrylic, ballpoint pen being my most effective medium.

Your support will be much appreciated to help me expand my creative reach and show others what I am capable of.:::3456:::609:::0.11661564625850343:::0.2891553287981859:::22:::0:::2015|||"

Known across the region for their chic and soulful sound as well as their epic dance parties, Midtown Social moved SF Weekly to declare that “An alabaster statue would have two-stepped to that magic.” Midtown Social is a diverse community of writers, musicians and dreamers. They are black and white, queer and straight, married and single. They represent the face of young America—and they are the new California Soul.

2019 is set to be Midtown’s year. Poised to release their newest album, Fantastic Colors, recorded at Zoo Labs in the heart of West Oakland with the help of producer, Jeff Kolhede, this compilation speaks with a voice of a generation that understands the power, importance and beauty of diversity. Each track represents a sound or aesthetic representative of that community by drawing upon the many colorful musical impulses that compose it.

Midtown Social has a story to tell. They sing of tribulation and triumph, and what it means to be an artist in American today. With every groove and back beat, they prove to themselves, to their socialites, to the world… you can’t stop the music.:::1407:::247:::0.1218693427784337:::0.239254230617867:::1:::4:::2015|||"

"2137579911:::795447073:::Arthur Sadowsky:::Arthur Sadowsky is now considered one of the top electric bass players on the New York scene. Currently, he is performing, composing, arranging and the musical director of “Arthur Sadowsky and the Troubadours” regularly gigging in Manhattan.

Arthur Sadowsky & the Troubadours perform a modern vision of classic jazz that is stimulating to the jazz enthusiast while at the same time very melodically pleasing to the casual music lover. Born and raised in the icy tundras of the USSR Arthur was surrounded by music and art from a very young age and knew this was going to be a life-long passion. Studying Russian classical music throughout his childhood it wasn’t until the age of 14 when he heard the music of Joe Zawinul that his life would change forever. Hearing jazz for the first time was the awakening he was looking for, according to Arthur “it was like being able to fly or speak to Dolphins.” He knew to pursue this dream he would have to leave his country. Arthur’s love affair with the bass guitar started when he was 16, he recalls “I was at a night club checking out a musician-friend of mine and the band was on break, standing alone in the middle of the stage was this sleek and sexy electric bass gently supported on a guitar stand by its neck. I was in love for the first time in my life and this passion will never wane.”

Through years of study, Arthur has perfected his craft as a performer, composer, and arranger and has truly created his own unique sound with heavy influences from the great lineage of jazz musicians most notably Duke Ellington, Thelonious Monk, and Joe Zawinul. “I can’t wait to see what is next for me on this artistic journey through life. I am looking forward to sharing my deep and passionate love of music with all of you, please stay tuned and never stop swinging.”:::1817:::337:::0.15876767676767678:::0.4228637658637659:::6:::0:::2013|||"

"1609857238:::27421303:::Robert Arnold:::My name is Rob Arnold, I grew up in the north-eastern suburbs of Melbourne Australia, moving from suburbia to farm and back again.

I recently returned from England and I am currently a stay at home dad. I try to balance my time by writing and creating, as well as raising my 3-month-old baby girl, with my wife and the help of my dog, Thor.

Creating comics is something I love doing, it’s something I feel passionate about and I feel lucky enough to have found it.

DEPRESSION/CHRONIC PAIN AND RELATING TO THE 'GOOD' GUY

It’s a weird thing to say I have depression. I have had depression and chronic pain going on 15 years. It is and or was one of those things that was rarely talked about when I was a teenager and yet as I grow older it is becoming a more common diagnosis.

I would be surprised if you didn't know someone with depression—whether they have told you or talked about it is another story.

In Australia nearly 3 million live with depression and/or anxiety (roughly 7%) and only 35% of these people seek or have access to treatment. So nearly ⅔ of people decide to suffer through it by themselves.

Sometimes it’s hard to realise that you may have it, or at least have the signs of it. It took me a long time to realise it.

I used to go to work with a notepad that had all the good things going on in my life and I would say them out loud and sometimes in my head. Girlfriend—check, job—check, friends—check, people that care about me—check, and so on and so on and repeat them until the cloud of despair lifted, usually some hours later.

I didn’t really realise this wasn’t normal until I would ask my friend how he was going and he would always reply 'Good.' How could he always be good and yet I was always struggling?

So with encouragement from my now wife I went and spoke to my doctor about it and have been managing it ever since. It’s not all sunshine and rainbows—but for the most part I feel good. The main difference is that it’s night and day from how I used to feel. I’m a lot more steady now and less like a rollercoaster. Before I sought help, being really happy was actually scary because you knew when it wore off you were going to crash and crash hard.

So I’m happy to say I have it—I have depression—and if by my saying it someone finds the courage to seek help, then for me it’s worth it.

So how does this tie into relating to the good guys? Well, I couldn’t relate to a majority of the superheroes out there with their 'be a good person and do the right thing and everything will work out ok' mantra. That is the biggest pile of shit I have ever heard and it honestly makes me angry because life isn’t that way.

You take an insecure teenager with zero confidence and tell him that everything will work out if he is a good person...what happens when he does those things and it doesn’t? He is left feeling alienated and alone and thinking that there must be something wrong with him. I related more to the evil characters. They were more mentally unstable and not perfect and even though they were doing 'evil things' a lot of the time from their point of view they weren’t. Why can’t we have a good guy who isn’t a picture of mental health? While we are at it why do we need to have a good guy and bad guy? Can’t we just have a guy or girl that does what they have to do?

Finally...

I want to tell you that feeling sad and depressed is OK. You are not alone and there is nothing wrong with you. Also it gets easier—especially with help.

I understand that sometimes it feels safer in the darkness; it’s comfortable; you know what it is—but you don't have to stay there.

If anything I have said relates or resonates with you, I would encourage you to talk to someone. It’s not going to hurt and no one will think any less of you for doing so. If you are uncomfortable speaking with friends or family you can speak to your doctor. If that doesn't work for you there are national help lines.

Hell, if you want to speak with me that’s totally cool as well.

HUMANITY

While I believe that our future depends on developing and exploring science and technology and learning as much as we can—for both understanding the universe and developing humankind—it is something we have to work diligently and carefully towards, because there is the danger of individuals and corporations exploiting science and technology for personal gain.

We need to make the world better for everyone—not just the privileged.

But as the gap between the rich and the poor grows further and further apart in real life, making the world better for everyone seems more and more unlikely. In Replicator this is taken to the nth degree—the rich and powerful are safe and protected, the poor are outcast/cast out, ravaged/decimated by disease and hunger. This is set in England, the last place you would think it could happen.:::5050:::956:::0.10542925371729715:::0.4726017943409247:::3:::74:::2014|||"

I realized there was potential to share my love of this craft by offering a selection of quality materials as well as complete kits to other makers wanting to learn the art of needle felting. In my online shop and at craft markets, you will find my handcrafted needle felted sculptures, my line of beginner level felting kits, and the same carefully selected supplies that I use in my own artistic practice.:::687:::127:::0.035574494949494946:::0.3799242424242424:::1:::1:::2018|||"

Au cours de mes nombreux voyages à l’étranger j'ai développé un style photographique qui se situe à la rencontre de l’Art et du documentaire. Du Grand Nord à la Côte Ouest, de l’Amazonie à l’Europe de l’Est, de l’Argentine à l’Irlande, mes sujets de prédilection sont restés les mêmes : les oubliés, les exclus, les marginaux.

Attirée par les textures granuleuses, brutes et grossières, je suis toujours à la recherche de contrastes forts : contrastes de textures et de lumières, contrastes entre le passé et le présent mais, surtout, contrastes entre l’attrayant et le rébarbatif, la sérénité et l’affliction, la beauté de la vie et son impitoyable cruauté.

Depuis maintenant quatre ans, je consacre mon art presque exclusivement aux personnes du troisième âge. C’est avec mes images d’aînés que j'ai récemment participé à de nombreuses expositions internationales et obtenu bourses, prix et honneurs.

While working as a journalist in the Great North, I began playing with documentary photography. This experience inspired me to do a Master’s degree in photojournalism at the University of the Arts of London, which I obtained with honors. During my numerous trips abroad, I developed a photographic style that combines art, documentary and social awareness. From the Great North to the West Coast, from the Amazon to Eastern Europe, from Argentina to Ireland, my most recurrent themes are the forgotten ones, the excluded, and the marginalized. Attracted to rough, grainy, even coarse textures, I am constantly on the lookout for powerful contrasts: light and texture, past and present, but especially contrasts between the attractive and the unsavoury, serenity and calamity, the beauty of life and its cold cruelty. I now devote a big part of my art to the elderly. I have recently participated in a number of international exhibitions on senior citizens, and obtained many grants and awards.

I was born and raised in Iowa but moved to Georgia just as I was finishing High School. After graduating I worked odd jobs in the restaurant industry and some construction work. A few weeks following 911 I enlisted in the United States Army. I knew our Nation was going to war, and as a young, physically fit man I wasn't comfortable with others sacrificing while i reaped the benefits. Shortly following basic training and AIT, I met the love of my life. Not to get too sappy here, but the very first words i ever spoke to my wife were ""yes, I will marry you"". We married 4 months after we met. We moved to Colorado Springs while i was stationed at Fort Carson in April of 2003. In May my son was born. 3 Days later I left for Iraq. Despite the challenges I faced during my deployment, to include my injury, I feel they were nothing compared to those of my wife who was in an unfamiliar state, halfway around the world from her family (Half British, Half Thai), with a baby by herself, at such a young age (18). I came home from Iraq in Feb 04 and worked through physical therapy for over a year before the Army decided on a medical separation. Over the next several years our marriage had its ups and downs, I worked in several different fields. We continued to expand our family and both went to school. While difficult, we both prevailed.

Her dream is to empower others through performances, workshops, and classes to step out of their boxes, increase their self-esteem and positive self-image, live through the music, and most of all, just have fun.

Amity assisted over a thousand people to learn their first dance moves through college classes, adult education programs, non-profits, and private classes. Preferred to be called a mentor, she encourages her students to study with various teachers and various styles in order to find their ""own dance.""

As a lifelong dedicated student of the dance, she attends numerous master workshops including travelling abroad to the Middle East to further her education. In addition, she has taken college courses and been involved with Middle East Forums and Discussions not only on the dance, but the culture from which this ancient dance from comes from. Amity has also cross-trained in other dance forms such as Ballet, Jazz, Modern, Flamenco, Ballroom, Hip Hop, and other Latin dances.

She has taught through college classes, adult education programs, non-profits, and private classes. She is the recipient of an Educational Programming Award in Middle Eastern Dance from Thomas College as well as the founder of the Thomas College Dance Company, which provides classes and performance opportunities to the community for many dance styles.

Amity is the founder and director of the Raq-ettes, the Twin State's premier Modern Belly Dance Troupe as well as a member of Vermont's own Hypzotique Belly Dance Circus. In addition, Amity hosts master instructors for workshops and performances in the Upper Valley on a regular basis.

She has performed in restaurants, fundraisers, and other private functions. Her style can be best described as Classic Oriental fused with Modern Egyptian. Her soft spot is for classical Egyptian orchestrated music; there is nothing more pure than a dancer hearing the music and interpreting it through her heart for the audience

"645843119:::2025259741:::AbBA:::A(b)BA - die Allianz (bedrohter) Berliner Atelierhäuser

Warum gerade jetzt?

Der Kunststandort Berlin droht von der privaten und öffentlichen Immobilienwirtschaft weggespült zu werden. In Berlin gehen im Jahr etwa 350 Ateliers verloren bei gleichbleibender bis wachsender Anzahl Suchender. In den letzten Jahren wurden zahlreiche Atelierstandorte mit ca. 250 Künstlern von privaten Eigentümern geschlossen. Zahlreiche Standorte sind in ihrer Existenz bedroht. 2014 haben sich daher 10 Atelierhäuser, mit über 500 Künstlern, zu AbBA zusammengeschlossen um gemeinsam den Ateliernotstand in Berlin zu bekämpfen.

AbBA wer ist das? Mengerzeile 1-3 Erkelenzdamm 11-13 (verkauft an Schwedische Investoren) Schultheiß-Quartier (verkauft an Shoppingcenterbetreiber) Köpenickerstr. 36 (verkauft an Russische Investoren) Prenzlauer Promenade 149-152 Palisadenstraße 89 (verkauft an Start-Up-Investoren) Gerichtshöfe Klosterstraße 44 Manteuffelstr. 77 (wegen Verdoppelung der Miete geschlossen) Stattbad Wedding (gschlossen)

AbBA fordert dass alle Möglichkeiten ergriffen werden, um bestehende Atelierhäuser, insbesondere in der Innenstadt, zu erhalten und so zu konzipieren, dass ihr langfristiger und bezahlbarer Bestand gesichert ist die Politk auf die Gründung neuer Atelier- und Kunststandorte durch Investitionszuschüsse und stadtplanerische Instrumente aktiv zu unterstützen dass der erhebliche Leerstand in städtischen und privaten Liegenschaften für kulturelle und soziale Zwecke genutzt wird dass Atelierhäuser als permanenter Beitrag zur kulturellen Infrastuktur der Stadt und zur sozialen und kulturellen Lebensqualität von Stadtteilen anerkannt und gefördert werden

AbBA stärkt

KünstlerInnen, Instrumente zur Sicherung von Atelierstandorten zu erkennen und zu nutzen
KünstlerInnen, neue Räume für Kunstproduktion zu finden und für die Zukunft zu sichern die Unterstützung der Atelierhäuser untereinander

AbBA plant

sich in die Senats- und Bezirkspolitik einzumischen
Aktionen durchzuführen, welche stadtweit Aufsehen erregen

Blind Beggar Miniatures has now run over forty successful Kickstarter campaigns, beginning with the Blind Beggar Launch campaign, which saw the birth of the company in December 2015,
Since then the Blind Beggar has added regular releases to those initial ranges of Pulp, Old West and Cthulhu Mythos themed miniatures.

2016 saw the introduction of the 'Outlanders' sci-fi setting, a range of figures suitable for classic sci-fi gaming that also work perfectly well for the Post-Apocalypse and Steampunk genres.

2017 saw the first of the Android Collectives come off of the production line. There are now almost thirty models in the range already and more are planned.

All of these ranges will see expansion with future releases on a regular basis, with the main emphasis being the expansion of the Outlanders range, but new ranges are in the development stage.

"843306629:::1197569634:::Tim Snider:::Tim Snider wanted to play violin from a very early age. An Itzhak Perlman performance on Sesame Street when he was just three-and-a-half years old was his earliest musical inspiration, and it was classical music that first provided the impetus to learn his instrument. Over the years other influences came into play, from exposure to rock music (he dropped the violin and picked up a guitar), a Ben Harper gig turned him onto songwriting, and sojourns in Spain and Cuba introduced flamenco, salsa and Afro-Cuban rhythms into his repertoire. Returning to college, he spent a year studying jazz, and rediscovering his love of classical music – and went back to the violin.

Today Tim is touring as the renowned violinist for American band Nahko and Medicine for the People. On his time off you can find him working on his own music. Tim not only plays violin but loops guitar, percussion, and vocals into a sound that has been described as a “world-folk hybrid, aimed at the heart the head and the feet.” His individual style of world folk and conscience rock will leave you dancing with a new sense of purpose.:::1111:::194:::0.13237012987012986:::0.37670995670995666:::2:::4:::2011|||"
"324928264:::969359321:::Ben Fletcher:::A UK based writer, speaker, producer and failed politician, Ben Fletcher was born just outside London. His first creative work came in the summer of 2012 when he undertook training in live radio production and presenting. A year later, his first book was released worldwide in e-book format before a few months later also becoming available in print.

During the 2015 UK elections, Fletcher stood as a local candidate for the Conservative party. Although not elected, his result was the best of the party in the seat for a decade and triple the vote of the previous election. As of the end of 2015, he is no longer a member of any political party, having left the Conservative party.

In November 2016, Fletcher's first novel, Three by Three, an espionage thriller aimed at a young adult audience was released worldwide. A North American edition of the book followed in April 2017, along with an e-book release in March 2018.

As a publisher, Fletcher has also released a number of other writers books through his own company and continues to work with new writers. With a proud history of annoying the far right, including attempting to swap 'respected columnist' (Donald Trump, 2015), Katie Hopkins for 50,000 refugees, and being blocked by the leader of the free world on Twitter for sending him a picture of a dog, in June 2017, Fletcher created and released Spicer in the Bushes for iOS, and in December 2017, released Not Much Happened, a satirical take on the failed attempts of former White House Communications Director, Anthony Scaramucci to find a publisher for his memoir.

More in July 2018, Fletcher released the script for his first attempt at writing for the stage, TRUMPED: An Alternative Musical. A satirical play parodying the 2016 Presidential Election Campaign of Donald Trump and his subsequent first year in office as President of the United States.

"1546793898:::580160142:::Atelier Martin:::The story of Atelier Martin is inspired by the richness of diverse cultures and defined by simplici-ty and functionality. After spending some years in Europe working closely with artists, Marie Martin combined her family’s move to China with the pursuit of her own calling: to make ceramics. Well-known for its ancient ceramic industry, Marie’s new home provided a compelling context in which to begin her journey, which started in a local studio among Chinese philosophical conversation and learning methods. The craftsmanship she encountered on her travels around Asia, from textile and furniture to religious artefacts, were vital inspiration alongside the cultures themselves. Witnessing people make time for what matters most to them - celebrating deities, revering and caring for elders - convinced Marie of the importance of the process of creating, as well as the finished result. This philosophy lies at the heart of Atelier Martin: from the clay preparation, throwing, drying, and firing, each step of the ceramic-making process is honored.

Marie Martin’s early days of Chinese-inspired ceramic making were built upon and enriched by studying at the American University City College of San Francisco. Here, the exploration of ma-terials and the pursuit of self-expression added a layer of sophistication and originality - yet al-ways with utmost respect for simple form - to Marie’s ceramic style. The birth of Atelier Martin is the story of these strands coming together, forming in a collection that is decorative yet functional; an oasis for the overstimulated senses; a celebration of ethnic design fused with understated simplicity. Marie’s recent Cocoon Series marries the warmth and tenderness of ceramic with the rugged utility of cotton rope. Each piece combines tactile sensu-ality with purpose: an indoor plant basket, or a home for your coffee capsules, yarns, or makeup products.:::1905:::300:::0.11702479338842976:::0.253913813459268:::1:::0:::2018|||"

see it. That alone drives me to create more, confirming that this is what I’m supposed to be doing in my life. Artwork is my passion which I can get lost in it for hours or days.

The sun was shining & life was a mini-vacation on a regular basis. As a Californians, we also experienced “fire season” and it was important to prepare each year to mitigate damage as temperatures rose & landscape got dry. When watching coverage of the damaged areas each year, we would see nothing but black char over all the land and burnt homes with little blue shapes by them. Quickly you realize all the blue shapes in the black are pools… Over the years that hasn't changed. Today, in 2018 I am seeing the same news stories with no solution's. A few years back, my dad, said ""What about the pool Water??? The average swimming pool holds 25,000+ gallons of water that should be used in an emergency.""

Edward Mayelian, the inventor & more importantly my dad, began to develop the product. He was an inventor, creating things such as a One Maned Submarine we claimed around in as kids.

This project was simple for my dad, he had an idea and was making it happen. He purchased equipment to crafting the correct component's, ordered supplies, conducted research and developed an outstanding prototype. Ed then organizing demonstration and reconstructed the idea upon feedback received. Prior to bringing FireFighter1 to market, he passed unexpectedly and the project was never completed. Today, I, Bianca C. Wittenberg, would like to bring the product my dad developed to market. This product should be in every home. If FireFighter1 saves even 1 life, the whole project is worth the years of hard work my dad spent. This year, I will be graduating from Sacramento State, obtaining my MBA, with a concentration of Entrepreneurship & Global Leadership. I was motivation to continue this project for my dad when a professor encouraged us to develop a concept for an entrepreneurial concepts contest. After taking second place at the SacState PITCH contest, I continued to further the idea, entering the Humboldt State University Future Four Business Concepts coemption. FireFighter1 won third place at Humboldt in 2017, encouraging me to believe people want our product and further development is a good idea. As an educated Entrepreneur, mother, daughter, wife and community member, I sees the unrealized need of FireFighter1. My hope is to keep our momentum going, and help my dads vision of FireFighter1 being installed with every pool pump a reality.:::2471:::413:::0.08052536231884058:::0.295291514041514:::1:::0:::2018|||"

"1040357310:::129724458:::Giona Ghimenti:::Mi chiamo Giona Ghimenti. Come avrete capito sono giusto un filino appassionato di fantascienza. Sono nato trent’anni fa in una famiglia di maestri vetrai, pittori, orologiai, cuochi e ceramisti. Sono cresciuto incapace di creare con le mani, circondato da arte materiale. Mi rannicchiavo un po’ sui libri, un po’ sui videogiochi (la mia seconda passione) e un po’ mi perdevo nei templi di verde e di azzurro che circondano il mio paese d’origine, Marina di Pisa. Col tempo ho capito che anche la mia vera strada era una strada di creazione. E che in un certo senso anche nella mia strada c’entravano le mani. Solo che la materia che potevo plasmare era impalpabile. Era fatta solo di parole. Ma con quelle parole ho capito che avrei potuto plasmare interi mondi, civiltà, esistenze. Di poterci giocare in modo da farle suonare, o da dar loro colore, gusto, tatto. Quella crescente consapevolezza mi ha spinto a crederci fino in fondo, creando l’Eterna. L’Eterna, ciò che dà il nome a tutta la saga che vorrei raccontarvi. L’Eterna: qualcosa che, se vorrete supportarmi, potrete scoprire cos’è. My name is Giona Ghimenti. As you may have guessed I'm just a little sci-fi enthusiast. I was born thirty years ago in a family of master glassmakers, painters, watchmakers, cooks and ceramists. I grew up unable to create with my hands, surrounded by material art. I curled up a little on the books, a little on video games (my second passion) and a little I lost in the temples of green and blue surrounding my home country, Marina di Pisa. With time I realized that my true path was also a way of creation. And that in a certain sense even in my path there were hands involved. But the matter I could mould was impalpable. It was made up of words. But with those words I understood that I could shape whole worlds, civilizations, existences. To be able to play with them in order to make them sound, or to give them color, taste, tact. That growing awareness led me to believe it till the end, creating the Eterna. The Eterna, what gives the name to the whole saga that I would like to tell you. The Eterna: something that, if you want to support me, you can find out what it is.:::2176:::405:::0.021417942176870746:::0.13752125850340133:::1:::0:::2018|||"
"966063621:::1151751330:::Micky and the Motorcars:::A lifetime of work has gone into getting Micky and The Motorcars to the forefront of Americana Music, which is where they currently stand. Micky and Gary Braun have been playing music their entire lives and come from a family of people that have always done the same thing. The boys’ paternal grandparents were both full-time musicians, and their earliest memories are of watching their father play with his brothers in The Braun Brother’s Band. Later, with four boys of his own, their father Muzzie Braun, formed a family Western Swing Band. The family toured the United States, making two appearances on The Tonight Show as well as taking the stage at The Grand Ol’ Opry. This laid the ground work for what was to come. After nine years, Micky and Gary went on to form Micky and The Motorcars while their brothers founded Reckless Kelly. Since music and family go hand in hand, it is with this family spirit in mind that the boys continue on their path. For thirteen years, the Motorcars have been touring the US, Europe, and Canada releasing five studio recordings as well as taking part in the Live at Billy Bob’s Series in which they released a live CD/DVD in 2009. They have charted several Top Ten singles on the Texas Music Chart, and had records that have spent an unprecedented seven months on the Americana Chart. Great music along with a tireless work ethic have been the two ingredients that have remained consistent since the band’s conception. The band averages over 200 shows per year and has built a dedicated following of people who appreciate great songwriting, great singing and excellent musicianship. The music of the band centers around the songwriting of Micky Braun. As a songwriter who has spent years crafting songs alone and co-writing with other songwriting greats, Micky has emerged as one of the best writers of his generation. He also has a voice that is able to elevate his words to another level, and the raw emotion in his delivery connects to audience members at their very core. Micky’s songs and singing are also blessed by his brother Gary’s undeniable vocal ability and guitar playing. Gary’s voice combines with Micky’s to create the unmistakable harmony that can only happen when two brothers sing together. The brothers are joined by Victoria, Texas native Dustin Schaefer on lead guitar. Dustin joined the band in 2011. Having started out listening to, and playing along with the greats of Rock ‘n’ Roll, Dustin soon immersed himself in the style of the telecaster country greats. The marriage of these two styles melds perfectly with the music of The Motorcars. The energy and dedication to his craft that Dustin brings to the band is evident in music and onstage. Houston native Joe Fladger signed on as the band’s bassist in December of 2011. Joe moved to Austin in 2001 and spent years playing in various bands in Austin’s fertile music scene. His sense of humor, rock solid playing, and dedication to the greater good of the team make him a welcome addition to the fold. The most recent addition is drummer Bobby Paugh, from Aransas Pass, TX in January of 2013 rounds out the band to where it is today. He brings great dynamics and professional demeanor to the table. Players play, so the future of Micky and The Motorcars will hold countless songs, shows, and a dedication to their fans that is unparalleled. As their legion of followers grow and word continues to spread, the journey of the band will continue to play out in a way that combines a dedication to music with a dedication to family.:::3546:::636:::0.17331404227955952:::0.30918435013262596:::2:::0:::2014|||"

"966134875:::799792179:::Matt Dahlberg:::While Matt Dahlberg may only be 26 years old, he's accomplished more with his ukulele than ever expected. A two time Ukulele Underground Undie Award Winner, Matt is known for his virtuosity as an instrumentalist with the ukulele and is considered to be one of the premier ""up and coming"" artists in a new generation of ukulele players.

Having already headlined the Cairns Ukulele Festival for its first three years, along with uke festivals held in Reno, Seattle, and Eugene, Matt is ready for 2016 to be his best year yet.

While Matt's abilities as an ukulele performer are well known, his unique passion for teaching is what has garnered the most attention. He's been featured in a front page article in the New York times in 2012 for his online teaching practice. Matt gives one-on-one ukulele lessons online from his home in Seattle and regularly teaches 30 hours of lessons a week. His workshops have been regarded highly worldwide as he has toured the east coast of Australia in 2010, 2011, and 2012, teaching ukulele to the masses. Matt is always looking for new students and enjoys teaching people of all ages and skill levels.:::1680:::287:::0.18202479338842978:::0.4902827223281768:::2:::13:::2013|||"

"65220691:::715154945:::Stephen Conway:::Stephen has run several businesses in his career, from restaurants to food recruitment, video production, design production and online marketing. Stephen not only created Heavenly Chocolate but also did all of the design work, websites, and video production for the brand.

Heavenly Chocolate was created in response to a gap in the market. Stephen has two young daughters aged 11 and 9 who are both dairy and gluten intolerant. His wife, Hazel, is also dairy intolerant. They are also much healthier (and happier) on a low sugar diet. As many families will recognise, this is a very common issue, and yet there are very few chocolate brands that are both dairy free and low sugar. Most brands are either sugar free or dairy free, and most of them do not taste that great.

Heavenly Chocolate is the best tasting vegan chocolate in the world! Don't take our word for it though - check out the reviews on our website and our video.:::934:::162:::0.16699999999999998:::0.3096:::1:::1:::2013|||"

"1519580404:::1468055163:::Nigel Price:::Award winning jazz guitarist Nigel Price began his professional career as an infantryman in the British Army. Upon leaving the forces he turned to music and now, over a career spanning more than 25 years, he has become widely acknowledged as one of the hardest working musicians in the business.
Musically, his blend of flowing bebop lines, deep blues sensibility and his mastery of chording continue to delight audiences and fellow musicians alike. His career highlights include a support show for Gladys Knight at The Royal Albert Hall and an appearance on Van Morrison’s recent album Keep Me Singing.
Starting his professional career in his early 20s, Nigel toured Europe with various reggae and funk bands before settling on a solo guitar career and turning his attention to jazz. Citing early influences as Wes Montgomery, Joe Pass, John McLaughlin and the Mahavishnu Orchestra, Nigel honed his craft by attending gigs and sitting in with the players of the time.
Nigel has played on more than 50 albums including 5 as a leader, spent ten years with acid jazz outfit The Filthy Six, was a member of James Taylor’s band for 3 years (with whom he recorded 5 albums) and performed with the legendary David Axelrod. He has also taught at The International Guitar Foundation at King’s Place, London.
He has worked tirelessly to organise his own tours (including a 56 date tour in late 2016) and has picked up a Parliamentary Jazz Award (Best Jazz Ensemble, 2010), a nomination for a British Jazz Award (Best Guitarist, 2014) and a British Jazz Award (Best Guitarist, 2016) along the way.
Nigel is a regular performer at London’s Ronnie Scott’s Jazz Club where he has made more than 500 appearances. He released his fifth Organ Trio Album
Heads & Tales Volume 2 in late 2016 to great critical acclaim. He is currently touring the UK with the trio who were winners of the 2017 'Best Small Group' in the British Jazz Awards.:::1927:::338:::0.14546626984126984:::0.32421703296703297:::3:::1:::2016|||"

And then, went on to get nerdy college degrees. We uprooted our lives and moved to a city chock full of every variety of nerd one could imagine. And then, we found each other. Other people who were just as full to bursting with joy, intensity, and odd facts about obscure subjects as we were. Fellow nerds. And we thought, “I can work with this.”

We’re passionate and ardent about the things that shape the way we see and experience the world. We want to know more, see more, share more of what makes us, collectively, tick. We believe in:

1. Unabashedly embracing your own curiosity. 2. Generously sharing of ourselves, our unique experiences, identities, and knowledge
3. Listening and learning from one another without pretense or shame
4. Being radically unafraid of the new, even if it’s scary And we’re making theater (or things that fall broadly under that heading) that is socially conscious, wickedly smart, and hopefully a little bit weird.:::1078:::197:::0.05460279566372003:::0.4581609461966605:::1:::0:::2018|||"

"1678575483:::1564019005:::Chevelle benson:::Chevelle has always been fascinated by how certain colours and materials can change moods or express emotions. Growing up, she enjoyed experimenting with styles to create her own unique look. As Chevelle progressed through her Art, Textiles and Design studies at GCSE, BETEC and HND, she discovered her true passion and talent. She loved working with different textures and materials and creating new designs. Chevelle knew she had the skills and drive to forge a career out of her creative flair. At 16 years old, Chevelle I held her first community fashion show in the heart of North London. The fashion show was a great success and she was thrilled with all the people who came to see her work and what she was trying to achieve as designer. Over the years Chevelle has developed her creative skill experimenting with different materials such as wood metal plastic leather and suede, as she tried to discover her most authentic and meaningful style. Chevelle is a great believer that fashion is a lot deeper than just designs and trends, but that it can be used as a vehicle to allow you to express yourself, your personality and what makes you unique. It was this question that inspired Chevelle to develop her LK London range. She was kept thinking what she could contribute to fashion that no other designer is currently doing? How could she make a difference and leave her mark on today’s fashion world? It occurred to her when she was taking her daughter to school on a typically wet and cold British winter morning. Chevelle began to notice children’s coats, the styles, designs, colours and how they fit. Her daughter being very tall for her age, she was looking at the taller children and how their coats fit. She noticed that coats, jackets and cardigans on taller children either fit on the body but had arms that were too short, or they fit on the arms and the body was much too big. Chevelle had often come across this problem finding outer wear to fit on daughter, either the body or the arms fit, but never both. Chevelle began speaking to family and friends who also had taller children and found that this was a very common issue. She began researching and found that there were no businesses offering clothing for taller children. Moreover, current standard sizing for children is becoming increasingly unsuitable as children today are much taller than they had been in the past. Chevelle’s designs are creative and innovative. She has been offering a bespoke clothing service for children, including taller children. The time she has spent operating this business has helped her gain the experience, knowledge, creative skill, business acumen and most importantly, the new range of designs that will make LK London a success:::2745:::475:::0.21918337097684926:::0.46698804818370043:::1:::0:::2018|||"

"1433536966:::553049542:::EXAUDI:::Since its debut in 2002, EXAUDI has emerged as one of Britain’s leading contemporary music ensembles. Founded by James Weeks (director) and Juliet Fraser (soprano), EXAUDI is based in London and draws its singers from among the UK’s brightest vocal talents. EXAUDI’s special affinity is for the radical edges of music, ancient and modern. In the domain of early music the ensemble specialises in Italian madrigals of the 16th century, from chromatic avant-gardism of Rore, Lasso and Marenzio and the microtonal experiments of Vicentino to the mature masterpieces of Monteverdi and Gesualdo. EXAUDI is regularly invited to give recitals of madrigal repertoire, recently in Milan, Naples, Luxembourg, Helsinki and Paris (Royaumont) as well as a series of concerts in Wigmore Hall, London and appearances at Aldeburgh and Beverley Early Music Festivals.

In contemporary music EXAUDI is at home equally with maximal complexity, microtonality and experimental aesthetics. The newest new music is at the heart of its repertoire, and it has given national and world premières of Sciarrino, Rihm, Ferneyhough, Finnissy, Fox, Posadas, Eötvös, Gervasoni, Skempton, Ayres, Pesson, Poppe, Fox and James Saunders among many others. EXAUDI’s many international engagements include Darmstädter Ferienkurse, Wittener Tage (Germany), IRCAM (Paris), Festival d’Automne (Paris), Pharos (Cyprus), Musica (Strasbourg), MAfestival (Bruges), CDMC (Madrid), MITO Settembre (Milan/Turin) and Quincena Musical (San Sebastiàn). EXAUDI has appeared at many leading UK venues and festivals, including BBC Proms, Spitalfields, Aldeburgh, Soundwaves, City of London, Bath, FuseLeeds and Huddersfield Contemporary Music Festivals, Dartington International Summer School, Kings Place and Wigmore Hall. EXAUDI broadcasts regularly on many European radio stations, and has released eight CDs, including most recently a disc of Rihm and Nono on ÆON.:::1916:::285:::0.15911976911976913:::0.23955724830724828:::2:::4:::2013|||"

"1295450060:::1160785016:::Scott Lindner:::“Artwork is the motivating force and the foundation of my life. It has always been the thing that grounds and centers me.”


Scott’s work most recently has been part of exhibitions at the J. Paul Getty Center in Los Angeles, MONA in London and the Butler Institute of American Art in Youngstown, Ohio.

Scott ’s artistic talent was recognized early in his teen years when he was encouraged to study with locally renown artist Cheri Mohn which he did for several years. After graduating from high School, he attended Youngstown State University in Ohio where he studied painting, photography and art history at their newly expanded art college.

During his time there, he was exposed to such artists in residence as abstract expressionist Alfred Leslie and photo realist, Lowell Nesbit. Scott's work immediately received acclaim and was seen in exhibitions at the University and the Butler Institute of American Art where he won significant awards for his work. Consequently, he internered with the director of the museum, Dr. Louis Zona, and they are in contact to this day. He graduated with honors with a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree and later taught art at his alma mater.

Scott’s uniquely original works are painted on canvas with a mixture of pure mineral pigments suspended in acrylic resin. With their intrinsic beauty, they are haunting representations of the subject. His equestrian paintings, are his most well known of all his series and known world wide. They have appeared in publications such as Dell magazine, LA Design Magazine, 805 Living, Lonnie Magazine and Hidden Hills Magazine. Several of his pieces have been purchased by art aficionados and music artists Brett Michaels and Nick Carter.:::1720:::289:::0.07502497502497504:::0.30632867132867136:::1:::5:::2012|||"

I quickly realized there was two needs in this town first it was the food options and second helping others in need. I quickly realized that both can be combined by one dream and passion of mine; food. I quickly found a trailer and started to build on it in 2016. My dream and goal came to a stall with the injury of my stepdad which was the one and only person helping with this project. He fell off the roof of the trailer and injured himself and it required surgery and lots of healing. Financially it put a strain on my plans because I had to help with his finances I felt it was my obligation.

"614250826:::1031487677:::Paul Craig:::We set out to solve a problem at the heart of pet food: despite the overwhelming choice of one-size-fits-all food in the shops, there was never anything that could tick all the boxes. Long lists of mysterious ingredients on the label only made things more complicated – there had to be a better way to feed dogs right.

And so we are here, with a team of nutritionists and engineers (and their dogs) to develop a super-smart way to create a unique recipe for every single dog – yes, even yours. From your dog’s weird preference for whiffy fish smells, to that itchy skin condition, your dog’s recipe is based on information only you could know.

Of course, it’s not just about the food. True to our original idea to help dog-lovers understand their doggo’s diet, our service includes one-to-one support for every customer. Got a question about your delivery? Give us a call. Wondering whether your pooch has the right portions? Drop us an email. Or if you simply want to chat about your dog, we’re here for that too.

Tailored food also means tailored packaging! We'll print your pets name onto your food packaging so that you can differentiate should you have more than one pet. A tailored website will be produced enabling you to submit your pet requirements. This will also allow for savings on recurring subscriptions or, you can simply just purchase one month supply! Each recipe will contain enough for 30 meals which will be automatically analysed using your submitted information and will take on multiple factors such as health, weight, age, pregnancies and any illnesses. That’s enough for now: it’s probably time for walkies. Tennis balls – mini or otherwise – at the ready.:::1691:::305:::0.10306122448979592:::0.39419879062736196:::1:::0:::2018|||"

Breastfeeding was not easy for me. I thought there had to be a solution that would help
And that is when I decided to start my own clothing line called, La Mere Clothing, clothes for the mother during pregnancy, nursing and beyond that compliment our beautiful evolving bodies. There are many women who choose not to breastfeed simply because we live in a society that doesn’t make it easy to do. With the creation of this clothing line we can help take mothers one step closer to giving their child the gold nectar; one step closer to celebrating our beautiful changing bodies.

"919049107:::1061745089:::Munchkin Metropolis:::Hi there, I'm Roger Kolikas. I'm the owner of a small construction/woodworking company called Munchkin Metropolis, where I specialize in custom items for kids mostly, but I've gradually been growing in the gaming accessory industry. Fancy custom deck boxes are pretty neat and add a bit of flare to anyone's deck!

I never did care for talking about myself much, but since this is the only way you can get to know me for now, that's about it for the business side of me. I've linked all my pages so you can get a better feel for who I am as a person and the quality of work you can expect from me should you choose to back one of my projects.

On to the personal side of me. (I don't have one, I'm a mystery....if mysteries weren't mysterious)

I was born and raised down south in Mississippi. My earliest memories are of playing outside with a stick (Sword) and fighting a terrible beast (Pet hamster). We had recently moved to a piece of property that only had a well for water. No house, barn, building of any kind, we lived in a tent that first summer. We were to build our house during our first summer there. And we did! (Sort of...I mean, it was a single room with plywood floor and 3 walls, the 4th wall was just plastic stapled to the studs. But on that wall is where we had our wood burning stove/heater. (I've never been as warm in a house since, and we had 3ft of snow that first winter!) We had a 5 gallon bucket and a sheet hung up as a bathroom. But it worked, and I loved it! We had a 55 gallon drum mounted with a draining hose that had a shower head attached, so we could shower on warm days...cold days too, but I don't count that as a shower. It was more like scrub scrub scrub, fast fast fast, let me out!

As you can tell, I had an AMAZING CHILDHOOD! It was like camping all the time. Booyah!

I go my first job at the age of 8, as a gopher (Go for this, Go for that) on the construction site my grandma's husband worked at. It paid $2/day....and that was a lot for me back then. I could go to the $1 theater on Saturday, play arcades, get the LARGE popcorn/drink combo and watch movies all day long with my own money. (That's right, MY money)

I learned at a young age how to live broke, and I'm glad I did. That knowledge comes in handy whenever life tries to knock me down. I grew up proper and joined the Marines at 17. Stayed there a few years before coming home and starting my own company (Woodworking, right?....wrong!) Selling at a flea market. It was good money sometimes, bad money sometimes, but I was the boss (Of myself only, but still, it counts....right?) I worked the market and craft shows for a couple years before stumbling into a mom & pop Video store (Old school, still did VHS and only had like 7 DVDs at the time). I bought out the bin of VHS they had for sale (At a discount so I could resell them) and I left them my number in case they had more to sell later on. Business must have been bad, because not even a month later they called and asked me to offer a price on all the movies they had left. I did them one better and offered to buy the store as it sat. That store's name was Reel World. Little did I know that one decision would change my life forever. I took that store and turned it into the first DVD only store around (This was back in 1996).... It did well until not 1, but 2 large movie rental chains came to town. But, you know the drill (Improvise, Adapt, Overcome)....So, I made a switch and started carrying more games. More and more kids started hanging out at the store and eventually one of them requested I start carrying Magic the Gathering (In my mind, wth is that?) Fast forward a year and we are the only shop around running FNM and JSS events. I cut the DVD rentals down to a single shelf, the rest of the space was for couches, TVs and original Xbox systems (We had 16 and they stayed full with kids play 16 player Halo over the LAN). It was a great time to game!

{But wait, you said you've been woodworking your whole life, how'd you do that while you were doing all this other stuff?}

The answer? I never stopped, it just wasn't a business, it was a hobby I did for fun. I also picked up leathercrafting along the way, just fyi. Munchkin Metropolis is a company I originally started as a home improvement company that specialized in Children's playsets, playhouses, furniture (We did grown up things too)

Eventually I married and got talked into selling the shop.... 6 months later they had ran it into the ground and all the local kids had nowhere to go. Of course I had to reopen! They must have a place to go! Throughout the years I've had 7 renditions of Reel World Games (We added the ""Games"", but kept the name of the original shop). And just 3 years ago, I moved right back into the same building where I purchased Reel World 20 years ago. Life is funny sometimes. Now I get to do both, Reel World & Woodworking, in the same building (Different bays).

I don't make a killing, but I'm pretty happy most of the time (Except on Sunday, that's when we count the register)

Now you know my story, why not message me yours? I love listening to how other people have lived.:::5177:::1015:::0.1509833084394488:::0.4003405504501995:::21:::13:::2014|||"

"1678392314:::1715845050:::Fortunale:::Who’s Ivan Aloisio, Founder of Fortunale

“My story begins forty years ago, in a provincial town named San Chirico Raparo, south of Italy, attached to the mountains and surrounded by forests, secular oaks, broom plants and their gentle scent.
A vital place for me, because I was born there, in my grandparents’ home. There, our family business, a textile industry, was also conceived, thanks to the courage of my parents willing to realize their dreams.

I grew up between yarn cones and fabric scraps, playing around textile machines and ironers, with their enchanting vapors. The textile industry was my home and in time it became my passion. This passion then became my duty and dedication. To this day I have the honor and responsibility to lead our family business.

Through the years, our firm expanded and moved to the manufacturing district of Cassano delle Murge, in Puglia, a small town in Southern Italy, immersed in nature and surrounded by the majestic Mercadante Forest. Our collections substantially improved, we exported in various international fairs such as Paris, France, and Dusseldorf, Germany; our products were bought by major European buyers. It was an incredibly productive period for me, and I was able to meet several clients and providers. During this time, I was also able to distinguish, with clarity, the most relevant negative aspects connected to the fashion industry: the textile industry waste and the toxic materials used in the dyeing facilities; color waste poured into the rivers, and the myriad synthetic and plastic materials that we wear every day. This awareness created an intense conflict in me which grew significantly after my son, Jacopo, was born.

An immense joy, accompanied by a continuously growing sense of responsibility and a persistent question: What can I do for his future?
That moment meant a lot for me, and I decided to create a different kind of industry, able to prioritize the quality of the “made in Italy” at the same time respecting the environment, nature and the well-being of workers and consumers alike.

I had never imagined all this, but, five years ago, alongside my son Jacopo, the project Fortunale started to take its shape”.

"1414551803:::1454786631:::NSKN Games:::NSKN Games and Board & Dice – two publishers merged into one company under the Board & Dice banner in November 2018 – were brought together by a shared passion for making and playing tabletop games. Games are more than a business to all of us, as being true gamers had made all of us fall in love with modern board games long before NSKN (founded in 2011) and Board & Dice (founded in 2013) came to be. The excitement and wonder of exploring new games – and even the happiness of enjoying the unmistakable “new game smell” – have never left us, despite growing our diverse gaming portfolios over the years. This excitement and wonder, fresh ideas and different flavours of board gaming adventures are what we bring you with each of our designs. With almost four decades of publishing experience between the members of our team, we have been delivering high quality products crafted in our offices, eagerly supported by backers, and played on your tables since 2011. With over two dozen games and expansions published, here are just a few of our products you might recognize: Snowdonia Deluxe Master Set, Teotihuacan: City of Gods, Sierra West, Dice Settlers, SUPERHOT The Card Game, Inuit: The Snow Folk, Exodus: Proxima Centauri, Edge of Extinction and Event Horizon, Beer Empire, Multiuniversum, InBetween, Pocket Mars, A4 Quest, Mistfall. The Board & Dice team are:

Rainer Åhlfors: A modern folk hero of our team, a man able to support anyone in the work they do, Rainer laboriously builds clear rulebooks, designs and helps develop our games, provides communication support for our Kickstarter projects, and often finds the best ways to approach the most daunting tasks. Also, his eye for detail is almost legendary! Filip Głowacz: How do you know that we are making a new and awesome game? Well, it is all thanks to Filip – his creativity, his graphic design skills and his amazing talent in telling you the fascinating truth of our great designs. Plus, his great work on game development makes each of our games not only a polished product but also a memorable experience. Ireneusz Huszcza: Board Games are physical things which need to travel great distances from the place where they are made to your tables – and without Ireneusz we could never make all the marvellous cardboard we make end up with you. Wielding power over spreadsheets and tables impenetrable by mere mortals, he is the man that makes the seemingly impossible possible. Agnieszka Kopera: There is only so much words can express when trying to explain a game – the rest is done by Agnieszka. The artistic design of our rulebooks and many game components and the clarity of all gaming visual aids is the outcome of her ability to tame the gaming chaos and force it to become a game you can understand and play in your very own home. Błażej Kubacki: Head developer and occasional writer, Błażej is also the man who keeps our Kickstarter project alive, our backer communication exhaustive and to the point, and our projects up to the standards you all expect from a bunch of passionate veterans like us.

Małgorzata Mitura: The newest member of our team, providing invaluable support with game development and skilfully turning ideas into some of the images that communicate via Kickstarter and social media the nature of the games we create together. Andrei Novac: Running a publishing house is like juggling a torch, two mouse traps and about eighteen greasy piglets – but Andrei is able to keep us running, and delivering quality products on time. A designer himself, nowadays he shares his time between managing our projects and a bit of game design and development as well. Kuba Polkowski: A man with a plan… for all the localized versions of our games, as well as for the artistic vision of most of our designs. Kuba also knows his way around marketing and social media. In fact, if you have ever tried to learn Welsh via a game of Snowdonia, you have him to thank for it. Paulina Wach: After a breath-taking debut on the board gaming market with the art for Inuit: The Snow Folk, Paulina has stuck with Board & Dice, becoming our in-house illustrator – a sorceress with incredible power to conjure images of style and beauty, making our games unique and unmistakable.:::4252:::729:::0.16379383901123032:::0.522217673630717:::13:::51:::2015|||"

"298234301:::37745093:::Paul J. Rimelspach:::In December of 2015 I picked up the guitar after some years of focusing on social justice. What transpired was the creation of BLEAECK - the musical project which branched from the prisoner support rag (of the same name) published through BlackDiamondPrisonerSupport. The self-produced publication was a mish-mash of thoughts, essays, fiction and soon included submissions from prisoners. It was distributed to some fifty political prisoners and prisoners of conscience in the months leading up the the September 9th 2016 national prisoner strike.

Throughout the following year I continued to compose instrumental acoustic-electro ambient stuff. Around the planning and execution of the Bend The Bars conference, THUH was formed - a more up-beat electronoisepunk project which made use of my Akai 8 drum-pad. The track 'Strike!' was published for release via CDBaby on 9-9-16 - the same day that prisoners around the country would begin a coordinated effort to bring about justice concerning incarceration.

The following year (to present), I created THUH podcast with my own original music as well as featuring other locals of central Ohio in an #AbolishColumbus compilation series. Grime Sisters and Saul Evals evolved from BLEAECK & THUH - vocals included. The podcast reveals a musical evolution from abstract to more concrete song composition/writing. Much of the music from the podcast will be featured in the 6 volume vinyl collection entitled [Black Kite].:::1469:::222:::0.07569444444444445:::0.1625:::1:::0:::2017|||"

"1968799203:::540476393:::Charleen Jones:::When Charlene Greer-Jones was recruited out of college for the Toys-R-Us management training program, she left New Orleans on a whim and moved to Fayetteville, having no idea that she’d discover Northwest Arkansas is the “retail capital of the world.”

For four years, Greer-Jones helped manage the local store, but because she had a young son — and her hours were so demanding — people suggested she consider work in retail merchandising.

Thirteen years later, she has tackled not only management, merchandising and store operations, but in diverse categories involving large retailers such as Wal-Mart Stores, Sam’s Club, Target and Best Buy. She earned a master’s degree in business administration and continues to raise her son as a single parent.

Greer-Jones is now a regional sales manager for InComm, handling partner acquisitions for a six-state region. She seeks restaurants to sell gift cards in Sam’s Club, and has helped secure more than 150 partnerships in the southeastern U.S.




Retail work offers change and challenges, both of which she loves. “Every day is different, and a lot of the things I’ve done are the things no one wanted to be doing: unloading trucks, working overnight and holidays, cleaning things, getting people to give me space for products.”

Greer-Jones has been a Den Leader and will serve as Cub Master this year for the Boy Scouts of Northwest Arkansas. She is a dark-haired player in the Blondes vs. Brunettes Charity Flag Football games supporting the local Alzheimer’s Association chapter.:::1547:::263:::0.09840754483611626:::0.28075757575757576:::2:::0:::2018|||"

He started to work regularly with the fashion industry and began a successful collaboration with the French jeweler Arthus-Bertrand. After Trump election, he worked on a six minutes film questioning the impact of violent images called Political Statement (2017). The film was exhibited at Le Coeur the parisian gallery with synchronized large images on three walls of the room to created an immersive experience. After his successful exhibition, he worked with the UN Women’s movement HeForShe, on an event for the social equality of the sexes at Les Arts Decoratifs. He wrote his first personal short film about a couple of three young people: Boyfriends (2017) which will be projected at the hotel Le Pigalle Paris.

Currently, I am in the UK being trained by my local Church in order to with my brother reach my people with the Gospel in the Island of Madeira. As such, I find that balancing a secular job, parenting and serving the Church is leaving me with little time for my studies. With this, I would hope to cut my secular job partially or even fully and devote myself to this project and my studies, giving me the flexibility to work around my Church service and Family life. This is an attempt to equip believers with a basic Overview of the OT and NT Books by creating a visual aid for each chapter.

If you are like me you can more than often remember a verse by heart but forget exactly whereabouts to find it. By using the shape of the chapter number I try to relate it to a key event/person and create an illustration. Visual aids normally stick better than repetition or listening to NT and OT Survey Lectures. I hope this helps you as it does me.

I did postgraduate studies in Cultural Studies where I specialised in fairy tales, and went on to teach Visual Cultures at Goldsmiths (and more recently at Cardiff University). Working with feminist icon Griselda Pollock I co-edited a book on masculine violence and identity in visual culture, called ‘Bluebeard’s Legacy’. I have a slew of unpublished fiction, which I’m very bitter (and not at all sweet) about, although I was signed to the Sayle Literary Agency for a while. Possibly I still am. I’ve always been fascinated by stories and storytelling, and in 2016 launched Spark Bristol, a live storytelling event. I became trustee and then Chair of Stretch, a charity that delivers creative projects and digital storytelling into prisons. I’ve been a regular contributor to numerous publications including The Conversation, The Big Issue, The Guardian and The Independent. I’ve got a number of new media projects that I’m developing, including a podcast, publishing imprint and further prison projects and I live on a boat and... and... and... once I wore a Union Jack hat to a street party. Is that 300 words yet?! The End.

Wallis Eates and Victoria Anderson came together while working with the charity Stretch. Wallis is an accomplished comic book artist who also runs Laydeez do Comics in London, and whose comic work addresses complex emotional issues and even trauma with sensitivity, humour and a characteristic light touch. She is currently working on another comic book, Like An Orange, which tackles the issue of brain injury and creativity and which will be published by Unbound Books in 2020. Victoria is a recovering academic who has taught visual cultures, cultural studies, media and literature (‘a mixed bag’) at a number of UK universities, and who writes regularly for a number of outlets.

"1391843194:::1466376638:::Bond Truluv:::Originally born and raised in Germany in 1981 Bond TruLuv became involved with graffiti-writing at the beginning of this millennium. Since then he has eagerly committed himself to examining new ways of composing letters and calligraphic ways of expression, as well as modes of fine arts and graphic design. His permanent longing for transformation and variation in terms of material and style is cultivated through extensive travelling as well as the search for environments and sceneries that inspire new pieces interactively.

The artistic map of Bond TruLuv features murals and exhibitions all over Europe, Africa and especially Asia (India, Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia, Myanmar, Singapore, Taiwan, Japan, etc.). There he found social life and culture happening extensively on the streets, offering a public forum where his graffiti would be appreciated by the locals and would adopt the various dominating atmospheres and emotions. At the same time he is constantly experimenting with different materials such as canvas, video and installations. The recently discovered tool of long-exposure photography combined with additional light-sources („light-writing“) enabled him to reach a new level of Graffiti-Art, creating spectacularily vivid images, morphing reality and dimensions within the letters and the locations they are applied in.

After receiving his MA in Anthropology in 2010 and participating in the „Darmasiswa“ scholarship at the University of Arts (ISI) in Yogjakarta, Indonesia he works as an independent artist, travelling all over the world from wall to wall.:::1587:::239:::0.11599747474747475:::0.4760274621212121:::1:::0:::2018|||"

"46105966:::1888036652:::Degenerate Art Ensemble:::Degenerate Art Ensemble is a performance company that creates original and adventurous productions using live music, physical theater and the visceral language of Butoh dance. Audio elements include live foley art, orchestras/Chamber ensembles, bands, newly invented instruments, and electronics. Their creative approach is intensely collaborative and is in a constant state of invention and re-invention. Aesthetically extreme, influenced by punk, protest, cartoons, nightmares and fairy tales, DAE takes the viewer into otherworldly landscapes — full of compelling characters and music that doesn't just accompany the action, but defines the mental state and reveals secrets to the audience that the characters will never know. DAE's work is a tightly wound mechanism made up of triggers and cues that when released on stage aims to achieve a heightened sense of awareness one might find in a sacrificial rite. DAE has been presented by On The Boards (Seattle), REDCAT (L.A.), New Museum (N.Y.), Festival Alternativa (Prague), T.F.F. Festival (Germany) and many others in ten countries of Europe and North America.:::1116:::169:::0.13361858379715522:::0.47264636157493306:::3:::5:::2012|||"

About Us

Sometimes the American West looks alien to those of us who have lived here longer than a decade. Things change irrevocably: Landscapes erode and seem to dwindle, views get obstructed, towns turn ghostly or expand exponentially, black soil fades into dust, new industries and ideas call into question our most cherished traditions and notions.

We see ever more clearly that the origins of these changes lie in our tangled history, a history that gets ever more complex the closer we look. It is a history that—despite (or because of) its challenges—has created a marvelously vibrant culture, one that embraces many thriving subcultures within its fluid boundaries.

Drumlummon Institute, headquartered in Helena, Montana, aims to explore these complexities in hopes that we can better understand our past and take better care in our present.

We will undertake an ambitious and ongoing examination of our region’s culture(s), especially the rich panoply of artistic expressions. To disseminate the outcomes of this examination, we will publish books and an online journal, sponsor symposia and conferences, collaborate with other cultural institutions, and produce documentaries and audio recordings.

"1849678648:::1548112546:::Liz:::I'm a scouser born and bred, the daughter of a modern version rag and bone man, my mum, a creative herself that never pursued her creative dreams. I guess that's where it started for me, the product of parents that were one half creative and half entrepreneurial...after that its kinda the usual story, I went through school and thrived in the art block, struggled to find my place anywhere else - and my dream to start my own creative business was cemented.

I flexed my young business skills, selling baby portraits to kids parents for pocket money in junior school. Thanks to Kylie in the 80's (with her extra thick hairbands) I hit a home run in my all-girl-high-school, sewing and selling headbands to over 1000 girls!
I was always chasing creative opportunities - I even got offered work experience in the Steven Spielberg Amblimation Animation Studios when I was 17, after which I got offered a position in their Hollywood Studios! (now known as Dreamworks)
But I refused - I couldn't imagine being that far from family that young.

Whilst still studying for my graphic design degree in John Moores University I started my own company designing flyers for local businesses - which all changed after two years when asked to design the album artwork for local band The Coral. When The Coral got picked up by Sony Music things really started to escalate and I went on to design for The Zutons, The Dead 60s and Toploader amongst others. They were mainly local bands, so I decided it was time to branch out. Now a 4 strong team we went on to design for The Artic Monkeys, The Stands including the entire catalogue for local record label Deltasonic - even venturing into music videos.
During this time I had my first child - and I realised I wanted to work smarter and be at home for her - that, and my role in my company changing to predominantly managerial as opposed to creative, made me take the leap to close the studio and start up again as a freelancer - and get back to the creative stuff I love. After a year of hard slog and struggle as a single mum things really took off and I had a blast designing for many record labels, but mainly Island Records. My Client list included The Klaxsons, The Feeling, Nicki Minaj, Jessie J, I Blame Coco, The Wanted and Queen. I owe them a lot. Two kids later (3 altogether now) and having designed to briefs for years I downed computer and started drawing again, late at night, when the kids were in dreamland...these developed into my illustrated prints and greeting cards which I sell on my etsy website.

There's no way of knowing which pins will sell when you design them - and I can't afford to send a design to manufacture without knowing if it'll sell...Kickstarter enables me to gauge how popular a product can be through pre-ordering - and if it's successfully funded to my kickstarter project target, it covers the manufacturing fees, so I can carry on creating pressure free knowing I've at least broken even! xxx:::2981:::533:::0.12968253968253965:::0.3976190476190476:::15:::42:::2016|||"

Mitt liv är så spännande, så kärleksfullt och så givande! Så såg min värld ut under min uppväxt på vår lilla gård i Karlskrona. Jag har fått lära mig att ta hand om naturen, djuren och såklart om varandra. Samarbete är av den största vikten när man växer upp på en gård. Att växa upp med brödrar och en jordnära familj har gett mig den absolut finaste livssynen, som jag idag använder mig av för att hjälpa, stötta och göra gott. Att hela det som är i sönder, hitta olika problemlösningar och plåstra om, det är mitt kall.

Efter gymnasiet visste jag egentligen inte hur eller vad jag skulle ta mig för. Mina betyg var väl kanske inte de bästa heller så jag gick runt och funderade på vad jag skulle kunna ge för att bidra något utvecklande till eftervärlden.

Jag funderade på att kanske utbilda mig till präst, jurist, sjuksköterska, mentalskötare. Ja, som ni själva kan förstå kanske så låg det mig varmt om hjärtat redan som ung tjej att få hjälpa och göra gott. Så jag utbildade mig till undersköterska och började jobba som mentalskötare på psykiatrin.

Jag älskade att jobba inom psykiatrin och mötte så många olika personligheter varje dag. Min ödmjukhet inför andras livsöden växte konstant och jag började fundera på om jag kanske skulle utbilda mig till special sjuksköterska. Men alla möten med polisen som blev under min tid inom psykiatrin fick mig att vilja utmana mig själv och utvecklas i en ny miljö.

Sagt och gjort!
Förväntansfull, glad och väldigt nöjd över mitt val blev jag till slut polis. Ni kanske själva kan förstå hur snopen jag blev som 22 åring när jag insåg hur mansdominerat attityden var inom yrket? Min fantasi var att få komma lilla människan närmre och hjälpa personer i utsatta situationer i vårt samhälle. En fin tanke tills jag insåg hur kollegor i min närmsta närhet mådde. Hur chefer inte kunde göra ett bra jobb pga det översitteri som fanns. Hur vissa manliga kollegor kom undan med sina övergrepp, sitt maktmissbruk och sina härskartekniker. Då insåg jag ju att polisen kan inte göra ett proffsigt jobb, rätt beslut eller ens kunna bemöta någon med empati när själva koncernen far så illa.

Så utan att tänka så blev det mitt kall att ""gå till roten"" med problemen så att jag en dag kan vara stolt över att kalla mig för polis. Så arbetet med att stötta kollegor, chefer och lära ut krishantering blev det som stod på min agenda.

Efter 25 år i yrket är det nu dags för mig att göra det största avtrycket i Sveriges historia! Som kvinna och dessutom polis ska nu Sverige och världen få detaljerad information och vad som egentligen händer bakom väggarna hos polisen.

"771947123:::1155726135:::Michel SANTACROCE:::Linguiste par formation universitaire (Paris III Sorbonne nouvelle), je ne deviens Docteur en Sciences du Langage qu'assez tard dans ma vie, en 1999, j'ai alors 40 ans.

Mais cela masque un parcours plus atypique, celui d'un jeune homme, né en 1959, curieux de tout (sciences et littérature), lecteur boulimique et épris de voyages, qui quitte l'école l'année du Baccalauréat (sans aucun diplôme à cette époque) pour partir à l'aventure.

L'aventure, après bien des errements géographiques (de la Scandinavie à la Grèce, en passant par l'Egypte ou la Turquie), se concrétisera surtout en Islande : un pays à cette époque (début des années 80') peu connu. J'y serai tanneur de peaux de moutons (Sutun en islandais), ouvrier dans le bâtiment, chauffeur particulier (de touristes) et même un temps en chômage technique, en 1979, alors que les températures à Akureyri (la grande ville du Nord de l'islande) avoisinent les -25°/-30° et interdisent tous travaux en extérieur.

Aujourd'hui encore, l'Islande reste un de mes centres d'attraction, une bonne partie de ma famille y demeure (dont ma fille aînée et mes petits enfants) : je m'y sens, comment vous dire ? Comme un poisson dans l'eau.

Ma carrière universitaire, mes activités de linguiste, restent très modestes (CNRS, Université). Je vais connaître un succès certain cependant surtout de 1999 à 2007, en tant que créateur, directeur de publication et rédacteur en chef de la Revue Internationale en Sciences du langage : Marges Linguistiques. Une aventure éditoriale (numérique) qui va connaître un succès foudroyant (plus de 250 000 lecteurs, et une centaine de pays concernés). L'entreprise est gratuite, bénévole mais aussi chronophage. Victime de son succès en quelque sorte, Marges Linguistiques s'arrête de publier, à mon initiative, en 2007... alors que Marges Linguistiques-L'Harmattan (les éditions de la revue sous forme papier) se poursuit quelques années encore.

Qu'importe ! La littérature, elle, ne m'a jamais quitté ... Ma vie se poursuit au fil de mes enseignements universitaires, de mes lectures, de mes passions et de mes attachements littéraires. Et puis, il y a mes Collages (commencés en 1977 sur des supports en papier) qui dans les années 80' avaient déjà été exposés dans différentes Galeries avant que la Linguistique ne m'accapare. En Mai 2017, je reprends mes Collages (désormais Photomontages numériques), et j'édite en décembre 2017 mon premier Album : Collages et Photomontages 1977-2017 - dans lequel se mêlent joyeusement oeuvres anciennes et oeuvres nouvelles : Mon premier livre d'Art en quelque sorte (une rétrospective).

Pour l'avenir proche, trois axes majeurs : les Voyages (la redécouverte de la Grèce est un grand bonheur), les Lectures (la littérature islandaise occupe une bonne partie de mon temps), les Collages à réaliser ....:::2841:::435:::0.044642857142857144:::0.09821428571428571:::1:::0:::2018|||"

"1394738378:::230589669:::LoveSync:::Hi, we're LoveSync.

LoveSync was started by my wife Jenn and I (Ryan) in 2017. We had been married over 15 years and created 2 wonderful children . Though still in love, our sex life had slowed and become less and less regular. This reduced romance in the bedroom played out in our daily lives as we became less connected and generally less capable of handling the challenges of life and a family together. As I reflected on our regularity of intimacy I realized that it wasn't one-sided. Some nights I'd be the instigator and she'd not be feeling it, and other nights the opposite would be true. Rejection is never fun, even from your partner of 15 years - so over time we each began trying less often.

Finally, one evening as I lay in bed wondering if she'd be the one to make a move I thought ""What if there was a way I could secretly and anonymously convey my interest and ONLY if she had the same interest would both our intentions be known?"" As a consumer robotics engineer, I knew that technology could likely present a solution. Not long after, we had a basic functioning prototype that allowed us to test my theory.

Sure enough, now that we can act on every chance where we're thinking the same thing, our frequency has increased significantly - and with it the quality of our relationship overall. Having shared our experience with others, it's become clear that our situation is not unique. In fact, as we researched the issue further, we found that the majority of couples are affected by some level of ""desire disparity"" in their sexual relationship. During her work as a manager at a marriage and family counseling practice , Jenn sees families every day who suffer from a decline in romance.

It is our belief that this technology has the potential to prevent this decline before it reaches a level of breaking apart families.

In her native southern Nepal border village, girls' births are not recorded in any official record. They are the unacknowledged. From the moment of her birth, society tells the rural girl child that her existence is unremarkable. If one's own birth does not matter, then the conditions in which she lives, works, strives, suffers and dies also do not matter. Growing up, Nasreen witnessed many atrocities against women. By age 9 or 10 , Nasreen's life seemed destined for the same oppressive path. She was working 15 hours per day in a Nepali sweatshop as a child laborer. She received less than $2 per grueling shift, only if she completed the hundreds of garments demanded of her. Nasreen ate, slept and toiled in her prison-cell sized sweatshop workstation. She recalls often picking sewing threads out of her food and being too afraid to look out of the window. By about age 21 Nasreen's family had arranged her into a forced marriage, Nasreen recalls: ""As girls, we are simply a commodity that is bought and traded as such. We are not human beings. With the help of a kind stranger who taught her to read and seize her destiny, Nasreen escaped the sweatshop and forced marriage.

Determined to empower disadvantaged women, Nasreen founded ""Local Women's Handicrafts and LOCWOM:::1404:::239:::0.002777777777777776:::0.27571428571428575:::2:::0:::2018|||"

His bright, developed tenor and masterful guitar work set the stage for classic, timeless storytelling. With influences ranging from James Taylor, to Bon Iver's Justin Vernon, Chris DuPont has long been charming midwest listeners, especially since the release of his lush, rawly produced LP, Anxious Animal. Anxious Animal transcends the singer-songwriter genre by incorporating ambient instrumental textures, and meticulously composed string parts. While Anxious Animal effectively explores DuPont's range as a composer, the record never loses sight of its center: DuPont's own storytelling voice. Chris's maturity as an artist is apparent from the stereo to the stage, whether performing solo, with backing band, or in support of other artists. When not working on his own music, Chris works as a sit-in player, session musician, producer, and sound engineer. Chris DuPont placed as a finalist at the Rocky Mountain Folks Festival in 2013, and performs regionally alongside acts such as Bennett, Matt Jones, Misty Lyn & the Big Beautiful, Wayward Roots, Dan Henig, Jeff Pianki, Abigail Stauffer, Jetty Rae, and more.:::1228:::187:::0.19206730769230768:::0.6497195512820513:::3:::30:::2011|||"

I'm really pumped about collaborating with some new comedy writers and comedy performers to produce a sitcom that will highlight important issues in life, such as mental health. I feel imparting information on important and sensitive issues is really needed, especially to the younger generation and we intend to achieve this though a comedic fashion. Comedy with purpose, not just to entertain.

The Company business refers to the cod. ATECO No. Ie 32.12.1 ""Manufacture of jewelry and gold jewelry in precious metals or bonded with precious metal"". General Preziosi was born as a general partnership, and in 1993 following the growth process, it was converted into a limited liability company. Simultaneously increased from an operating area of 130 square meters to over 650 square meters. The GP's core business is the production and sale of gold and silver findings, by the search of the most sophisticated production and management methods. The production process, with the exception of some secondary processing steps committed to external suppliers are entirely developed all inside the company. This allows GP to occupy a particularly market segment, guaranteeing an excellent value for money.Since it was founded, for the maintenance, repair, development of new machines and development of special equipment, GP has always preferred to invest in the creation of an internal mechanical workshop in order to ensure rapid repairs of many machines and the research, development and application of new technologies for internal use only.
In 2000, GP acquired the business branch of a company , operating in the production of silver finished products. So, GP has been specialized in thisbranch too, and has associated later also finished products in gold, further diversifying its production range.
In 2008, the GP has purchased its first cutting machine CNC starting a design and cutting path in its own and for other customers in a positive trend that now employs four cutting machines and a laser. In 2009, GP acquired the business branch of a company , operating in the production of casting gold silver and bronze items. So, GP has also specialized in this segment, expanding the wide range of product with the addition of casting items with stones and the developing projects for several companies in this sector, in order to diversify one more time its products.
In 2011 GP diversified its production by manufacturing non-precious metals, such as bronze and brass. GP has been among the first companies to do that, with the goal of penetrating even the jewelery market, achieving excellent results in the biennium 2012/2013. From 2013 on, GP has been started to develop the stretch bracelets production techniques, always testing items the quality, the resistance in order to meet our customer’s request in the fashion world.
Today the product has grown in quality, working and above all on design. It fit great and it is finally ready to meet the international jewellery market.:::2811:::452:::0.11568496683628263:::0.29653972367788156:::1:::0:::2018|||"

In early 2004, the debut album, “On The Edge of Time” was recorded and released in Italy through Battle Hymns Records. The album took Ivory Moon to a higher level, and the response, especially in Italy, was overwhelming.
In late 2005, the line-up went through some changes, and the band started to work on new songs and ideas for the next album. During 2006, Ivory Moon took residence at Temple of Noise Studios in Rome, to record “Human Nature”. The album was tracked, mixed and mastered by Christian Ice. Dark Time was released in 2012 with Spider rock promotion. It was the most complete album of the band and after the promotion tour with Freedom Call, we’re currently working on our fourth studio album with a renewed line-up made up of old and new friends. Following previous three albums, our new work will keep true to the style of the previous records but with a much more modern sound.

"805759312:::1854277102:::Oliver Stephenson:::From a young age I've had a passion for business, not surprising considering that both of my parents are entrepreneurs. Growing up to watch my parents businesses grow and learn about it just made me want to strive for success. I first built up the confidence to get involved at the age of 12. The Internet was something I was very familiar with and knew how to use, my first venture was a simple eBay store. Anything I could find, I'd sell via eBay. The success I achieved from that gave me enough to begin manufacturing my own product, which ultimately was something I'd always wanted to do. I sourced some good factories in China via Alibaba and had my own brand within a matter of weeks. I proceeded to try and sell my brand through eBay, yet wasn't getting anywhere. This lead me to look into other sales platforms, it became clear that the best solution was to develop an ecommerce site for my business and promote via social media. After watching a number of tutorials I was off, the first site launched in early December, I'd only contacted the factory in October. By Christmas through a strict social media regime and plenty of interactive posts like giveaways, I was able to sell out. At this point I was 13, to sell out of a product within a week of launch seemed mesmerising. From then on I was hooked.

Since this initial entrance into the online business world I have developed a number of successful brands. More recently however I have began branching out into different areas, I've written business plans for apps, offline businesses and some websites that offer a service. As much as I've enjoyed retail, I feel it's now time to begin innovating.:::1665:::305:::0.19570312499999998:::0.33708457341269843:::1:::0:::2018|||"

Akané Yorita

Lorsqu’en janvier 2018, j’ai commencé une année de recherches au TAMAT (le Centre d'art contemporain du textile de la Fédération Wallonie-Bruxelles) à Tournai, j’ai été interpellée par la facilité avec laquelle il est possible de franchir la frontière entre la Belgique et la France.
L’existence de limites territoriales entre ces pays, n’empêche cependant pas, qu’autour de la frontière, de nombreux points communs existent (architecture, gastronomie, culture, etc). Ces « lignes », immuables et pourtant abstraites, ont été une véritable source d’inspiration.
Tournai et Roubaix sont des villes liées par le textile. Cette exposition à la Manufacture, sera un moyen de perpétuer ce lien à travers mon travail.

Dans le livre « Une brève histoire des lignes* », l’anthropologue anglais Tim Ingold analyse la production et l’existence des lignes dans l’activité humaine quotidienne. La notion de « ligne » existe partout dans notre environnement. J’ai exploité ce principe durant mes dernières recherches, à travers plusieurs approches : les installations de fils, les réseaux sur les cartes et les liens imperceptibles entre les humains tels que « le fil du temps ». Cette exposition à La Manufacture retrace le fruit de mes expérimentations pour « Recherches 18 », ainsi que des pièces créées au Japon. Au cœur du musée, au milieu des machines Jacquard, les vieux kimonos japonais sont accrochés selon la routine traditionnelle du « Mushi-boshi », qui signifie « aérer des vêtements avant de s’habiller ». J’ai choisi cette notion pour introduire une idée de renouveau, un nouvel usage des kimonos. Après leur installation pour cette exposition, ils commenceront une nouvelle vie, entre les mains des créateurs de « Maisons de Mode » Roubaix et des étudiants de l’Ecole supérieure des arts Saint-Luc de Tournai.

"304465170:::257535412:::Christopher Chau:::Born in China, I graduated from a premium university and started my career for a high-level job. I was not satisfied and dreamed for future outside China. So I moved alone to Hong Kong and then to Singapore for a better life.

It was not easy to start working in Singapore. I learned many from every boss about Entrepreneurship, of which the most memorable one is their fighting spirit. All these I learned were helpful in the tough time of my companies set up later.

Tea business was a hobby in the beginning. However, I was satisfied after helping my first tea beginner to choose the right tea he likes, to get better wellness in health after cultivating drinking preference. This sparked my interest to do it better, as I enjoy the achievement of helping people.

The difficulty of setting up tea business is capital for building up quality tea inventory, to wait for 8-year vintage to click-start. The key resources are the supports form my main business and microloan from local bank endorsed by Spring Singapore.

To make such an idea LIVE, on traditional oriental Chinese tea making from a modern western capsule machine, I found Kickstart as a great platform, which links us up with the end users who we are caring about. This is not only helping idea creator in terms of investment but also the interaction, the involvement, and the self-achievement for all of 3 parties. Together, we shall make life more beautiful.:::1434:::247:::0.15945552463409607:::0.46393140589569165:::1:::0:::2018|||"

"997653352:::887939186:::Sebastian Frisch:::Pangani is an Austrian psychedelic music project formed by Sebastian Frisch in 2014. His musical journey guided him through reggae bands, street-music in kenyan hoods, sound-art installations and various electronic music explorations all around the world. During his Artscience master studies, he started to develop his Pangani performance setup. Instruments like the Foleyboard enable the artist to freely play in the moment and let his audience experience the magic of sound creation. In kiswahili, the word “Pangani” describes a place of spirits, where energy can be felt and vibrations make you move. As a sonic wizard, Pangani fuses otherworldly soundscapes and deep basslines into adventurous psychedelic dub. Detailed synth work and crisp complex beat constructions are braided with flashes of vocals and acoustic instruments, to create bubbling and pressurized imaginary sound worlds. In Pangani’s live shows, sound-designed puzzle-pieces meet the “foleyboard”, a self-built percussive synthesizer. It contains a sound reactive wooden surface, on which all kind of objects are used to generate sounds, which are than manipulated to shape sonic landscapes. This setup enables him to improvise and let his audience experience electronic live music in a one-man-band setup.:::1278:::195:::0.14768939393939395:::0.35583333333333333:::2:::1:::2011|||"

"1055028389:::1158833153:::Dogpatch Farm:::Out of frustration with our food system I started raising our own food in 2012 so that my family could eat antibiotic free, humanely raised meats. I grew up 35 miles north of Boston and though I always loved the city, it was obvious that I gravitated to the countryside every chance I had so I decided it made sense to live where I wanted to vacation. I never set out to become a farmer, I don’t think anyone would have predicted that, especially a hog farmer, but life has some funny twist sometimes. I love what I do and I’m thankful for all who have supported me along the way. I worked in the food industry for many years before switching over to working with animals by volunteering at both a vets office and a wildlife rehab. I now blend my love of animals and my love of food together as I raise happy healthy critters for the table.

Mulefoot Hogs are a critically rare Heritage breed and I know it sounds odd, but you have to eat them to save them. Unless there is a market demand, farmers will not grow them, so we can all do our part one meal at a time. Far too many animals have already disappeared from the face of the earth; I'm hoping Mulefoot are here to stay. I also raise small flocks of chickens for meat and eggs as well as Thanksgiving turkeys.:::1267:::247:::0.2595454545454545:::0.6000000000000001:::3:::0:::2015|||"

Soy desarrollador de videojuegos y apps y amante de los videojuegos desde niño.

Estudié Ingeniería Informática en la UPC Barcelona y luego Graduado en Arte y Diseño en la UAB Escola Massana de Barcelona.

Cuando era niño también estudié varios tipos de arte visual en una escuela de arte local durante más de 7 años y también estuve más de 8 en el conservatorio de música clasica, tocando el violín.

Aunque no llegué a graduarme, simepre obtuve altas rgaduaciones desde pequeño.
Tengo mucha iniciativa y siempre he querido inaugurar una empresa de videojuegos, mucho antes de esta fiebre por los videojuegos... Entonces empecé a trabajar en Movistar y en videojuegos como vendedor y encargado, empecé a ver este mundo des del punto de vista de negocio, entonces decidí empezar a aprender a desarrollar desde cero practicamente.

En Febrero de 2016 empecé, por mi cuenta, mi trabajo como Diseñador de Videojuegos y Desarrollador de Apps para Android (ahora también para Apple) con el motor Unity. También empecé con el diseño 3D y animación con Blender. Desde entonces, he publicado mi querido Dragon Invaders, que no está teniendo muchas descargas porqué estoy muy ocupado con los otros proyectos como para promocionarlo y aun está en beta version.

Hago todo el proceso desde la idea hasta la publicación. Mis proyectos pueden tener un 1% de descarga de assets y también música CC para ahorrar tiempo

A día de hoy, estoy desarrollando un juego tipo Candy-Crush, que e lugar de caramelos cayendo tiene globos subiendo que deben pasa a través de aros con su color, también hay abejas que explotan nuestros globos mientras dejan pasar los globos abeja que reducirán nuestra barra de puntos. Hay 3 modalidades de juego

Si quieren ver mi trabajo, jueguen a Dragon Invaders en Android, recuerden por favor, que está hecho por un solo dessarrollador Junior (en aquel entonces).

Me gustaría publicar este “Bees and Balloons” en 2 – 3 semanas. Para poder organizar el RPG que empezaré a desarrollar en Enero de 2019.

Quieroinauguarar mi mperesa, aun así en España, la industria del videojuego está creciendo más lentamente que en otros paises, con lo cual, el gobierno y los bancos no invierten en esta industria tanto como los gobiernos y bancos de otros paises.

Naturalmente, la cantidad que reciba de los promotores será enfocada en: primeramente, promocionar este juego (que estábasadoe n un modelo que lleva años funcionando en varias empresas), y mejorar la retención de usuarios; y segundo, montar un equipo discreto para trabajar en el mantenimiento y el marketing de “Bees and Ballons” a la vez que mejoramos y completamos Dragon Invaders y lo empezamos a promocionar.
Trabajaré duro para que todo este trabajo esté sobre ruedas para antes de Año Nuevo.

Estoy abierto a sugerencias y aprecio mucho cualquier ayuda que puedan aportar.

Si Ud está interesado en ser parte de Odderworld, por favor hágamelo saber.

Muchas gracias

My name is Angel, I'm 33 yo from Barcelona, Spain.
I'm videogame and app developer and also videogam lover since I was child.

I studied Computer Engineering at UPC Barcelona Faculty. I also studied Degree at General Artistic Knowldge.

When I was child I also studied several kinds of visual art at local art school for more than 7 years and also 8 years of classical music and violin.

Even when I didn't finished my degrees, I always got high marks since child. I have lot of initiative and I always wanted to start my own videogame company, many time before this videogame fever.. Then I started working on Movistar (Telecom services) and videogame stores as seller and manager and started to see this world from the business perspective so then, I decided to start learning how to develop from zero.

On 2016's February, I started, on my own, my work as Videogame Designer and App developer for android using Unity, (I'm now ready for Apple too), since then I published my beloved Dragon Invaders, which is not getting many downloads because I'm busy with other projects now and it is still a beta version. I also started with Blender 3D design and animation.

All my projects are full made by me, they may have 1% asset download and music downlaod, even when I could compose songs I decided to save time using CCO music.

Nowadays I'm developing this CandyCrush-like game, not with candies but with balloons that have to pass through their colors rings, and there are some bees destroying your balloons, while they let pass bee balloons which will decrease your points. There are 3 sorts of stage.

If you want to check my work, play Dragon Invaders for Android, remember that it's made by only one Junior (back then) developer

I would like to release this ""Bees and Balloons"" in 2 or 3 weeks, in order start organizing the RPG I'm going to start develop next January

I want to start my company, eventhough in Spain, videogame industry is growing slower so banks and governement don't invest on it as much as other countries. Naturally, the amount I could get from promoters will be focused on: firstly, promoting this game (which is made based on a already-working model), then improve the user's reten; and second, I would like to oragnize a little team, start as company and work on the maintenance and marketing of ""Bees and Balloons"", at the same time, improve ""Dragon Invaders"" and promote it.
I'll work hard to have all this work running by the end of this year.

I'm oppened to any suggestions and I highly appreciate any help you can contribute.

If you are interested in being part of Odderworld, please let me know.

I started in the basement, with a recycled carpet, an old fashioned light hanging from the ceiling with a pull down string, an a shelf to hold my supplies made out of reclaimed barn wood held together with 4"" nails that my father and I built.

My hobby has changed over time, with a few local awards for painting and some larger awards in painting. But truthfully my passion has always been creating and painting terrain.

About a year ago I got into 3D printing, with having a family, I no longer could find the time to spend 20+ hours making a cabin or a small structure, so I needed a new way to create wargame tables that really brought the game to life. 3D printing was that solution.

There are many files out there for 3D printing, but no one had what I've been looking for, a war torn, medieval city that's been ravaged by decades of war... all that remains is shadows of stone structures as invaders take anything they can use to create their war machines.

I wanted a set of ruins that you could build in many different ways, I wanted area terrain and small buildings, and large buildings that blocked line of sight. So I drafted a plan and got lovecraft to help bring my vision to life.:::1268:::238:::0.08695513334402222:::0.23729410507188284:::2:::8:::2012|||"

Bill Webb has over 300 books to his credit—
writing, developing and directing the creation of over 150,000 pages of fantasy RPG material as the creative director. His best known works include Rappan Athuk, The Sword of Air, The Slumbering Tsar Saga, Tome of Horrors, Wilderlands of High Fantasy, Dungeon of Graves, Demons and Devils, the Crucible of Freya, and The Lost City of Barakus (with WDB Kenower). His works have won several ENnie Awards.

Matt Finch is the ENnie-award winning author of Swords & Wizardry, the simulacrum/clone of the 1974 Original Edition rule-set. He is also the author of the (somewhat infamous) Quick Primer for Old School Gaming along with several adventure modules and gaming resources.

Chuck Wright worked with Necromancer Games on some of their free products as well as cover layouts and layout & typesetting before becoming the layout and Art Director for Frog God Games. The most well known of these would be the Gold ENnie award-winning ""The Lost City of Barakus"". He also donates his spare time on the site D20PFSRD.com converting (and eventually creating) creatures for The Pathfinder Role Playing Game.

Zach Glazar was a little of everything before launching a kickstarter under his own small press company, Lesser Gnome for Whisper & Venom in 2013. Whisper & Venom and its follow-up, Death & Taxes, were Ennie nominated and well-received box sets stuffed with everything from books to dice to figurines. Zach became a partner at Frog God Games in 2016.

Michael Badolato joined Frog God Games in 2017 as customer service manager bringing a long life of experience with games, shipping and gamer gatherings with him.

Edwin Nagy, the Fifth Edition Coordinator, made himself so indispensable that he went ahead and became a partner at Frog God Games.

All Frog God projects on Kickstarter and beyond would not be possible without the tireless efforts of both John ""Pexx"" Barnhouse and Jerry Baker who are more visible and active than those who should know better.:::2160:::350:::0.16220833333333334:::0.47133333333333344:::26:::44:::2012|||"

"974398290:::1459744377:::MAB:::It all started when Jon and his close buddy Ryan Golden were engaged in a serious conversation on the driveway outside of the party. During their talk, Dakota Mann, the younger brother of Jackson, a hosting graduate, took control of the unattended microphone as the band performing at the event was on break and called out Jon because of his recent Facebook video.
“Will Jon Berry, please step forward? I repeat, Jon Berry, please come forward.""
Upon realizing that he was being called, Jon and Ryan looked at each other, smirking.
“You have got to be kidding me.” Or something like that…
After a bit of hesitation, Jon entered the party and performed a portion of Tom Petty's Free Fallin’.
A couple hours later, Michael, who had gotten into music around the age of 14, showed up a fashionable four hours late. Having been friends for several years already, Michael and Jon discussed what had occurred and decided to get back up to the microphone together to put forth a bit of John Mayer’s “Waitin’ on the World to Change.”
As a result, Michael and Jon decided to spend time together over the following few weeks, working on a cover of “No Diggity” by Blackstreet.
In the fall of 2016, Jon returned to the University of Maryland for his senior year and Michael continued his studies at NYU.
It wasn’t until June of 2017 that the duo was back at it. This time, however, the two decided to write their own song, and their first original track ‘Maze’ was created. Yet again, time passed before the two got back together in the cold of February 2018. With aligning schedules, they agreed to create 10 songs over the course of the Spring, which would be released under the name Michael & Berry.
After the two released Free Alone on Instagram, their first track of 2018, fellow Byram Hills alum Nick Groll reached out to Michael and Jon, offering to produce their album. They both gladly accepted the offer and made tentative plans to start production once the 10 songs had been fully drafted. About a month later, Alex Katz, another Byram Hills alum gave Jon a call to inquire about collabing with the duo on a track. After running the idea by Michael, they both decided to put the song Dream Lake on hold and have a go at it. The three guys clicked instantly and came up with the track On My Own. Excited by Alex's musical talent, Michael and Jon welcomed him into the group. After just a few evenings of working together, and the Katz magic touch, the three officially founded MAB.
Finally, at the end of July 2018, Nick was available to produce MAB’s first album. With the addition of Nick's tremendous musical talent, our first album CHRONICLES OF A FREE SOUL came to life.:::2683:::497:::0.08169191919191919:::0.34179292929292926:::1:::0:::2018|||"

I completed my 4 year bachelors degree in less than 3 years since my parents had to pay twice the normal tuition (non-resident). Also, since students on visa did not qualify for financial aid, my parents had to pay my tuition in cash.

"1704592942:::2016681159:::Robin Snyder:::WHO ARE SNYDER AND DITKO?
IN THE BEGINNING
Sharon Levine and Gavin Callaghan, among other readers, have asked about our early produced material, how we got together, where have we been, how and why we began self-publishing and so forth. Here is a recap for those who missed the story in the pages of The Comics! Snyder has written and edited stories and books including Batman, Katy Keene, Popeye, Steel Sterling, Turok, Son of Stone, and more. Ditko, the original artist on Spider-Man, Dr. Strange, Captain Atom, Dr. Haunt, Konga, Gorgo and others, can also be found in an astonishing list of titles: The Fantastic Four and The Incredible Hulk to The Many Ghosts of Doctor Graves and Witzend. Snyder and Ditko began working together at DC and went on to a variety of publishers, ever seeking opportunity, new ground. You may have seen or heard of some of this work: Charlton Action featuring Static, Flash Gordon, Gobots, The Missing Man, Murder, Tales of the Mysterious Traveler, etc.

EXPLORERS
After years of working for others we struck out on our own. From 1988 to date we have continued earlier features and/or introduced a variety of new characters, concepts and publications. We have published 65 books, hundreds of articles and essays, our little periodical, The Four-Page Series, and the first-person history, The Comics!, now in its 30th year of publication.

My true loves are my husband, Bruce and our three boys, Ocean, Forest and Rivers. We live in southern New Mexico, in a tiny village that borders the National Forest where we go exploring daily. Lady Swim evolved after years of being frustrated with the selection of swimming suits offered to women.

Jon Pareles of The New York Times calls her “a songwriter with a voice of unblinking tenacity…who finds parables in the everyday and also finds humanity behind the archetypal.”

Klein released three albums with former indie giant Rykodisc (2000-2005) which launched her career around the world. She has since toured the U.S., UK, Europe and Japan on her own and with such artists as Arlo Guthrie, John Fullbright, Damien Dempsey, and Carlene Carter.

"260565085:::617836260:::Idem Colony:::César et Aghiad se rencontrent adolescents, à 13 et 15 ans. Le premier vient d’un milieu d’artistes et le second d’une famille syrienne engagée politiquement. Le groupe dont César est le chanteur cherche un nouveau batteur, et c’est Aghiad qu’ils trouvent. Un lien privilégié s’instaure entre les deux jeunes musiciens. César a besoin de communiquer son désir de faire, de créer, d’avancer. Il se voit comme Freddy Mercury et n’a aucun doute sur ses rêves d’avenir. Aghiad a érigé Albator en héro, et comme lui pense à l’espace, à la beauté de l’égarement. Leur amitié nait dans l’art comme un lieu de liberté et d’expression. Aghiad et César découvrent Joy Division et New Order, et comprennent ensemble que la musique sera centrale dans leur quête. Entre 2009 et 2011 The Crowns fait le tour des salles parisiennes. César et Aghiad, dans leur romantisme, se démarquent des deux autres membres, stimulés par l’énergie pure et un esprit punk. Mais alors que le groupe commence à grandir, il se dissout au gré des projets de chacun. César se lance dans sa formation d’acteur, Aghiad poursuit ses études à Sciences Po. Au moment où sort le premier film dans lequel joue César, L’origine de la violence, Aghiad est à la frontière turco-syrienne et poursuit des recherches sur la région, qui feront l’objet de son premier livre. Les deux amis se retrouvent après ces réalisations, aussi belles qu’éprouvantes, et partagent le désir de retrouver la musique comme refuge.
César a écrit une chanson très folk.Aghiad lui fait part de ses idées et ses
influences se mêlent au morceau. Nous sommes à l’été 2016 et c’est autour
d’Everything I Hear, titre évocateur, que nait Idem Colony.
Avec l’aide de Julien Vichnievski et Eric Spring, anciens deThe Aikiu qui réaliseront leurs premières productions, ils vont construire un son emprunt des références folk et Indie Rock chères à César, et des sonorités New wave d’Aghiad. Les chansons mêlent avec précision des références aussi diverses que
Bon Iver, The XX, Hot Chip et Arcade Fire, la voix grave et puissante de César se
confrontent, dans un conflit créateur, aux arrangements plus froids d’Aghiad,
dessinant ainsi les contours de leur premier EP. Aghiad et César se ressemblent dans leur effort de réflexivité, mais chacun a une façon distincte de se penser dans le monde, et donc dans leur univers musical.
César a une foi en la vie et c’est sa subjectivité qui le guide. Aghiad questionne
l’existence avec l’objectivité du scientifique.
La première date est un tournant. Après plusieurs semaines de réfléxion les deux membres décident d'injecter du sang neuf pour compléter leur formation. C'est ainsi que Billy Sueiro, ancien du groupe GriefJoy et Lylian Szpira rejoignent Idem Colony et en deviennent des membres à part entière. Idem Colony, même tribu, est un quatuor guidé par le retour aux origines communes,
et une certaine forme d’humanisme artistique.:::2916:::534:::0.03848651348651348:::0.07325174825174825:::1:::0:::2018|||"

"533560848:::1282254821:::RFLKT:::Last year, jokingly, after Alex had been hit by a car while cycling to University, I gave him the advice of wearing some reflective clothing so he could be seen.

We thought, instead, of creating our own fashionable alternative to high visibility – something that we could wear and stand out, but still appropriate and stylish to wear in our everyday lives.

There are over 5,000 fatal traffic incidents involving pedestrians and over 18,000 cyclists severely injured annually. RFLKT aims to help by being a fashionable alternative providing visibility for individuals. With a 3D Hexagonal Honeycomb reflective design, RFLKT users can become visible from a light source over 300 meters away. According to recent research, high-visibility gear of this type could reduce the risk of a vehicle on cyclist collision by 55%.

After months creating designs of our bombers and pants, we built a strong relationship with suppliers, sourcing all our product from the UK. We made a few prototypes and tested their effectiveness and durability in different environments. Being happy with the results, and people giving us very positive feedback on the pieces, we decided to spread the word and launch a Kickstarter campaign to make these clothes accessible for everyone.  At the same time, RFLKT products are fully customisable, so you can select from a variety of colours of tape for each model of your choosing. Check our Kickstarter page and pledge if you dig our products or want to support the cause.

Thanks,
Alex and Thomas

Harry finally reemerged as a manager signing John Kearns three years before he won a record two consecutive Perrier awards. Harry then carved a route into directing adapting The Mighty Boosh's Rich Fulcher’s Tiny Acts Of Rebellion book into a five star Edinburgh show culminating with a sell out run at the Soho Theatre. Together they launched Fuchfest a live improvised cabaret show featuring the creme de la creme of international comedy talent that sold out to 200 people every month at The Bull And Gate which ended when Rich Moved back to America. <p>
As well as live Harry writes and directs films which include the cult web-series Shambles set behind the scenes at the night he used to run. This garnered a loyal but small fan base and has lead to a development deal with Channel Four for a new show which he wrote, directed and starred in. <p>

Finally since he retired from management he has become an accomplished live performer with three Edinburgh shows under his belt, an appearance in the 2014 Fosters Nominated Sam Simmons show Death Of A Sails-Man and a support slot for legendary musician Bill Callahan on his UK tour. <p>

It's a little difficult to explain my work myself, so here's a little excerpt from an interview I did with a friend:

''Briggs’ photography in a sense, is a memoir of herself, an exploration of her expressions. Her camera acts as a mirror, be it in the literal sense where she takes self-portraits or more abstractly where she shows herself through the subjects in her portraits. She moves to her camera, using it as a form of articulation of some of the darkest moments in her life and it is the honesty and bravery in the way she uses it that makes her work all so compelling and noteworthy.""

"2007253988:::551427393:::Rey Lalaoui:::Hi! I’m Reyhan Lalaoui, the founder of County Films and the director of its latest project.

When I was eleven, I read a Toni Morrison quote that changed my creative direction forever: “If there’s a book that you want to read, but it hasn’t been written yet, then you must write it.” It struck a chord with me immediately.

For as long as I can remember, I’ve searched voraciously for characters and stories that reflect the communities where I live and learn. Growing up in a multicultural household as a young Moroccan-American, I’m used to the beauty of blended tradition – but why didn’t this unique dance have a place in the movies/television I watched and the books I read?

My academic path was my main focus for awhile and I graduated Hudson County Community College in 2017 at the age of sixteen, the youngest Valedictorian in the college’s history. Now, as a Communications major at Saint Peter’s University and an aspiring filmmaker, I’m in a position to do something about the dearth of voices I’ve observed for so long. I hope for this project to explore the unique mountains my generation has to climb, spark much-needed dialogue, and shine a light on Jersey City’s cinematic opportunities. Inclusivity, authenticity and honesty are the three principles upon which I aim to base the media I am working to create.

We’re here – and we deserve to have our stories told right.:::1395:::266:::0.11143127705627705:::0.5835714285714285:::1:::0:::2018|||"

Eager to break into the Colorado music scene and continue their ministry, Dead Set Saints crafts heavy-hitting anthems and breakdowns inspired by the likes of Disciple and Spoken, articulating scripture and life experiences into raw, untamed melodies. the band is currently writing and recording their debut ep, slated for a 2019 release.:::816:::132:::0.023145299145299135:::0.35048717948717945:::1:::0:::2018|||"

I plan to do product testing and get feedback so that I can make changes to the products. Since I have a passion for green living I plan to use glass jars, glass bottles, and biodegradable paper based bags for products. The inner lining of the biodegradable bags is a plant based material not plastic. I will use these products for myself, children, and family! The utmost care and love goes into making my products.

A little bit about my professional life:
I am a professional chef with close to twenty years of culinary experience. I received my training through three years of apprenticeship and two years of culinary school. I have been the Executive Chef at The Clay Center in Charleston, WV, I owned and operated The Wild Mountain Grill in Spencer, WV along with a successful catering business too, and I currently write a food column called ""Speaking of Food..."" for Spencer Newspapers, Inc.

I have been blessed in my career with opportunities to feed folks from all walks of life. I have catered to politicians, actors, musicians and other performers, but my greatest satisfaction comes from feeding those who come to the church dinners, the family picnics, or the neighborhood cookouts. I love feeding the folks around me and making them happy. With your help, we can bring this happiness to more folks in more communities.:::1366:::242:::0.2846875:::0.39479166666666665:::1:::0:::2015|||"

"1861070496:::1872273873:::LYA VLACK:::La artista gaditana nació en Florida (EEUU) en el año 92, desde pequeña siempre destacó su pasión por las artes, en especial la música. Laura, como realmente se llama, comenzó a escribir desde muy pequeña, poesía y relatos. A los trece años se subió por primera vez a cantar al escenario de su colegio canciones de Celine Dion, Mariah Carey o Whitney Houston, desde entonces no ha parado. Durante su adolescencia, sobre el año 2008, estuvo en tres grupos de música, lo que potenció su motivación a componer letras y canciones, pasando por los estilos rock, blues, soul y pop, tocando por su ciudad canciones de Led Zeppelin, AC/DC, Ray Charles, Nirvana... Se presentó a varios concursos musicales y fue ganadora de uno local llamado “Cantando bajo la ducha” donde grabó su single “música” como premio. Tras mudarse a Sevilla por sus estudios en 2011 tuvo nuevas oportunidades, comenzó a trabajar como cantante de orquestas, cantando por Sevilla, Cádiz y Málaga. A su vez quedó finalista de un concurso sevillano llamado “Operación talento” que fue una experiencia muy bonita para ella. Durante estos años comenzó a participar en jam sessions de la localidad sevillana y comenzó su pasión por el jazz.
De vuelta Cádiz en el 2014, estuvo solo un año más cantando en orquestas, decidió cambiar el formato de trabajo. Optó por ir sola con un equipo de sonido y cantar canciones de Aretha Franklin, Ella Fitzgerald, Amy Winehouse o Bruno Mars… tanto para fiestas privadas como para amenizar cenas. Se hacía llamar “Laura V” y la podías ver en una Oktoberfest o en una cata de vino. Tambien fueron dos años muy intentos y gratificantes porque compuso su primera maqueta “Minefield”, compuesta por cinco canciones.
Pero Laura sentía que todavía no había hecho algo que le hiciera ser ella misma hasta que en 2017 tuvo la oportunidad de volcarse en su primer trabajo que sería titulado “Cosmos” junto con el sello independiente TMK Records. El LP esta compuesto por trece temas, de los cuales doce están en inglés y el “bonus track” en español. Publicado en Spotify, Itunes y Google Play y además con 500 copias en formato físico, ha sido todo un logro personal para ella.
En noviembre de 2017, mostró su primer single “Maybe” y un mes más tarde sacó el segundo llamado “Get Out”, disponibles ambos en Youtube con sus videoclips.. La cantante asegura que componer y escribir cada tema del proyecto ha sido una experiencia increíble. Ha plasmado su sensibilidad fusionando estilos, en mayor parte urbanos, que han hecho que Cosmos tenga un sonido peculiar enfocado al rhythm and blues y neo soul. Con la colaboración de diferentes productores norteamericanos y europeos y un largo año de trabajo personal, la artista apuesta por la sencillez de ser uno mismo, algo que afirma que no es nada fácil y que aún es un universo por descubrir.
``Cosmos es el resumen de mis 25 años´´
Laura, actualmente viviendo en Madrid, siente que Cosmos fue algo que ella siempre llevó dentro y ha sido ahora cuando se ha sentido capacitada para mostrarlo al mundo. Cuenta su filosofía de vida sin tabúes. Para ella y sus capacidades, Cosmos no puede haberse expresado musical y visualmente mejor. Al igual que su nombre artístico, todo tiene un sentido pleno para ella, y recalca – “se escribe Lya, pero se pronuncia Laia- . Lya Vlack no se rinde, simplemente quiere ser feliz haciendo lo que más ama, cantar. Este 2018 ha sacado tres sencillos en español, disponibles en Youtube y Spotify. Aspira a tener un grupo de trabajo personal que enfoquen un sonido nuevo de manera diferente y poder rodearse de profesionales del sector de la industria musical, para mejorar como musico, como persona y poder llegar a muchas mas personas que se enganchen a su filosofía de vida.
Actualmente esta involucrada en su nuevo proyecto llamado “Virgo”. Siente que esta encontrando un estilo diferente, personal y sincero. Un estilo que le va a permitir seguir creciendo como mujer y como artista.:::3959:::691:::-0.003826530612244898:::0.04897959183673469:::1:::0:::2018|||"

"62737048:::1358956787:::Cheryl Walsh:::In an overwhelmingly chaotic world, Southern California based artist Cheryl Walsh finds her inspiration in an atmosphere of peaceful solitude. In the depths of her underwater studio, she works with the quiet currents that slow down time, bring vibrancy to colors, and leave her subjects virtually weightless. The liquid atmosphere, invisible but ever present in the reflection on the water’s surface, is a mirroring of the duality that personifies life. Her fine art photography is described alternately as old-world painterly and photo-realistic, traditional and surreal. Combining the science of working underwater with the art of photography, she utilizes vintage and avant-garde fashion on dancers, models and clients to tell a deliberate story in each of her fine art series. Along with her Southern California based Fine Art photography, Cheryl runs a successful High School Senior portrait business, AltSenior Photography, and is raising her twin daughters.

I grew up surrounded by chemical plants, refineries and pollution. My dad was diagnosed with two types of cancers before I was born. The cause was likely due to an accident when he was working at the refineries.

This tragedy has made me stronger and more independent, because I grew up seeing my dad's health deteriorate. Ever since this I had a motive in life, to stop pollution in all forms.

Two years ago I created my own environmental organization. In the past 7 months my beach clean ups have removed 1,000 pounds of trash off the coasts of Texas.

Beach cleanups are the solution that is at the end of the problem. I wondered if I could solve the beginning of this problem and prevent trash from entering the ocean. Then I came up with an idea, and it transformed into something so special, and I owe the ocean its creation:::913:::169:::0.09253663003663003:::0.23434065934065937:::1:::0:::2017|||"

With a background in business and marketing and a passion for herbs and natural health, a business was soon born.

As a former publicist and mother of five, I'm passionate about herbs and natural health. I love nothing more than to use my creative talents to carefully research and develop beautiful new tea blends that are nourishing for the body and that take advantage of the bounty of the Pacific Northwest. Winterwoods Tea is carried in coffee, grocery and retail shops through the Inland Northwest and in about 300 shops across the United States. In addition to direct sales through our website, we also work with a natural foods distributor for distribution to 48 states. In 2015 Winterwoods Tea was selected a Kickstarter Top Pick and raised almost $35,000 towards building our own commercial tea studio and kitchen.:::1082:::182:::0.1867845117845118:::0.3528619528619529:::3:::9:::2011|||"

"395887794:::1764330182:::Bob Raymer:::In south Louisville near the heart of Valley Station, nestled away on busy Dixie Highway was recently home to a gathering place that not only provided a family friendly atmosphere with good company and conversation, but a menu of home cooked meals that kept people coming back again and again. Bob and Alicia Raymer’s “Highway 31 Diner” hosted several full house crowds that demanded signature dishes such as the “Kong Burger”, which consisted of 2 pounds of meat, a half-pound of macaroni and cheese, 3 slices of bacon, 4 slices of cheese, and a full pound of fries. This meal provided the reward of being on the house if finished in full in one sitting, as well as receiving your picture and name on the “wall of fame”. Other famous menu items consisted of classic sandwiches such as the Rueben, the Cuban, and Highway 31’s “lazy meatloaf”.
Highway 31 was only in business for 8 short months, but in that time, they developed a lasting relationship with their community, giving back wherever they could. They offered free meals to local law enforcement, donated food to local elementary schools, hosted pancake breakfasts and car washes, also helped out the area’s homeless when in need of a hot meal. These efforts earned them a top 3 vote for “Louisville’s best new restaurant” in Best of Louisville magazine, and a feature in Topps Magazine as well.
Despite the sudden close of their family business, The Raymer’s dream is still alive and well. Bob intends to venture into a brand-new project that will offer the same great food, but at a smaller location with less overhead, while continuing to give back to his community. The success of their catering business, “Gorilla Grub” proves that accomplishments are possible if you want something bad enough, which has been Bob’s mindset for as long as he can remember.
Bob and Alicia Raymer have always prided themselves on being good people who put everything into what they do. Their hard work and passion for providing good food for people like themselves reflect onto every plate that they serve. Regardless of how big his kitchen is, Bob will always push himself to be better than he was the day before, and his talent for finding ingredients that change the way people eat will forever be what drives him to be great at what he does.:::2293:::420:::0.24028721278721282:::0.461509879009879:::1:::0:::2013|||"

Deduction Card Game, VERTIUM: Shadows of the Complex (SciFi), SHOOTERZ Hockey Card Game, STRIKERZ Soccer Card Game, WORDOPOLIS, and the author of Gold & Sharpe (a novella inspired by Get Adler!). I grew up in beautiful Cape Breton, Nova Scotia. Looking back on my childhood, I can remember inventing games.
At around 9 and 10 years of age, I used to sit down outside and show hockey cards to my beloved dog Spotty. I also made mini baseball games in the dirt with sticks and small pebbles. And best of all, I used to cut out those same hockey cards and play hockey at the kitchen table, with a silver ball for the puck: the foil from my mother's cigarette package.

Fast forward to the late 90's, I got an eye injury at work, which made me photophobic. I couldn't take bright lights and had to wear sunglasses all the time outside. I couldn't watch TV and I couldn't work on computers. The kids and I seemed to go back in time, and we spent many evenings reading, listening to the radio and playing games. Much to my surprise, I began to invent games again ...

I have had lots of help through the years, and I thank God for each person and each invention. I hope you will enjoy the games we bring here. Caper Games - bringing games to life! Enjoy! Randall:::1336:::250:::0.13415637860082305:::0.27132201646090537:::24:::43:::2015|||"

"344454270:::226463443:::Erin Roddy:::Designer by day & always looking for another race to run, Erin Roddy is on the mission to redefine women's active apparel by fusing fashion, function & philanthropy.

Mid-westerner at heart, Erin was born and raised in the beautiful city of Cincinnati, OH, where she grew up running cross country & track, while falling in love with designing and creating her her own wardrobe & prom dresses. After high school, Erin found herself struggling with severe anxiety & depression and found herself bouncing from job to job, lacking in confidence & self worth, she lost her passion of becoming a designer & the love she had for running.

Through much self help, support & the encouragement of friends & family around her, she began to set goals. The first being the Cincinnati Flying Pig marathon at the age of 19. While this was a huge personal success & allowed her to feel confident in attacking her plans While this wasn't the end of her struggles, it was the beginning of her uphill battle with depression. In 2008 at the age of 25, she attended the University of Cincinnati's renown design school, DAAP & at the age of 30 she graduated with Fashion Design Degree & scored her first job as Designer in NYC.

Why She is Starting MEAS?
In 2013, Erin moved to NYC & began her career in the fashion design industry. The lifestyle to grow as a designer did not allow her the time or freedom to follow a healthy lifestyle and continue to run. She found that she was endlessly working day in and day out for mass consumptive design brands and although she was doing what she loved, something was missing. She didn't feel she was giving back in any positive way, nor was she physically & mentally taking care of herself. She began volunteering for Girls On Th Run NYC & found herself craving the the opportunity to give back. Running was something that had always made her feel strong, confident & she enjoyed passing that along to young girls in a positive way. This also reminded her of the importance to take care of her own health & wellness.

In 2016, she decided to take a leap into freelancing allowing her a bit more freedom to dive back into running & continue to give back, while she looked for that perfect design role that allowed her to feel proud of that brand & product, along with maintain a personal healthy lifestyle. As she scoured the job market for a company that would be a good fit for what she was looking for, she became increasingly frustrated, as it didn't seem to exist. This sparked the idea of creating a women's active apparel brand, that celebrates & support women in all walks of life, while promoting health & wellness.

What is MEAS; pronounce 'me'

In 2017, a childhood mentor of Erin's had moved to Cambodia for 2 years to volunteer for a non-profit organization that helped rescue young girls from sex trafficking, called Destiny Rescue. This inspired Erin to raise funds & volunteer for a 2 week trip with Destiny Rescue.This took her to 6 cities in Thailand & Cambodia to help with various volunteer work & to interact with the many young rescued girls. While on this trip, Erin learned of an ancient Cambodian proverb which translated to say, ""Men are gold, women are white linen.” Meaning that once a woman is ""dirtied"" she can never be cleaned. However, if a man is ""dirtied"", he can be shined like new. As Erin interacted with the many young girls on this trip, she knew these young ladies had been through so much pain & suffering, however when playing a simple board game with them, the joy, laughter & hope in their eyes reminded her how strong a woman really is. A woman is GOLD, she is MEAS; the Cambodian word for Gold.:::3673:::639:::0.18239127384960718:::0.3892126122334456:::1:::1:::2018|||"

"1633289447:::1295174381:::Vic Toria:::From the cover of the Spring Issue of Ukulele Magazine to the front page of The Wall Street Journal, Victoria Vox is making appearances everywhere—and rightly so. The artistry of her performances is both unique and endearing, captivating an incredibly diverse audience and drawing even the least musical of folks into her harmonious web. Soon after graduating from the Berklee College of Music (Songwriting 2001), a friend gave her a ukulele, and the small, four-stringed instrument proved to be the unexpected, but welcomed vehicle to showcase the upbeat, rhythmic drive that is characteristic of her music. The 'ukulele-toting and an award-winning songwriter — including for songs she has written in French— has donated songs to causes like the American Asbergers Association and the Duchenne Foundation. Her music has also been used in indie films and featured on NPR's ""To the Best of Our Knowledge"". Vox has been teaching workshops for ukulele and songwriting at ukulele festivals since 2006. She has also been a featured guest artist at the Center for Children (San Diego, CA in 2010, 2014, 2016) and her original song, ""The Bird Song"" was included in the New Zealand Ukulele Trust songbook for kids (2014-2016). She traveled to New Zealand in 2014 to perform ""The Bird Song"" alongside 2,500 children singing and playing ukulele. Vox has completed 7 school residency programs (2015 - 2017) where she worked with children on ukulele playing, singing, and songwriting.

Originally from Green Bay WI, via Baltimore MD, she is newly based out of Costa Mesa CA, but tours across the USA and internationally at venues and festivals which celebrate original music, French music, and/or the ukulele.:::1699:::274:::0.1430537518037518:::0.3206421356421357:::4:::21:::2011|||"

"1354022309:::2032089502:::Brian Revels:::Brian Revels is energy and angst in a comet trail of music that is as perceptive as it is entertaining. He hearkens back to an earlier time, a bygone era when words were
true and hearts were strong. His observations of Americana ring with authenticity, with
the rawness of earth, the clarity of rainwater and the depth of the sky.

He’s a wily veteran of the Atlanta, Georgia music scene, a multi-instrumentalist, a natural-born storyteller with a poetic edge. He helped to build the
band City Mouse into a regional force before it was finally time to step out on his own.

He’s from folk and blues and country and bluegrass, an alternative to them all and a better man for their influences. The hole he’s worn in his guitar is not as large as the one he’s worn in his heart with the cares of the lives he hopes he can redeem one song at a time.

Be sure you see him now so you can say you knew him when – before the wider world discovers him and lifts him away. His timeless musicality will touch your soul with the drama, and the significance, of love lost and regained, of the human frailty that reduces and yet ennobles each of us.:::1144:::221:::0.29417989417989415:::0.5236992945326278:::1:::1:::2018|||"

"1327315427:::726873859:::SÃOMHA:::Singer and guitarist SÍOMHA (pronounced Shee-va) dances the line between folk, jazz and neo-soul effortlessly, taking audiences on an unexpected, and unforgettable journey with her soulful melodies. Coming from a family steeped in music, SÍOMHA grew up on a diet of musical greats, with the sounds of jazz, trad, folk and soul creeping in and leaving an indelible mark on her musical tastes and influences. She started playing guitar at age 10, but it was later in her teens while attending high school in the south of France that she first took up jazz guitar, after a chance encounter lead to her learning from an Italian gypsy who taught her the manouche gypsy jazz style. The chords and sounds of jazz fascinated and inspired SÍOMHA, and she began to craft her own songs.

The next few years saw her travelling, with music as her compass, soaking up the sounds of each of the places she travelled and further honing her craft. In late 2016, having traversed America, Canada and Mexico, she felt an innate draw to return to home shores and a phenomenal few years have followed, including slots at renowned festivals such as Electric Picnic, Clifden Arts Festival, Doolin Folk Festival, Sligo Live and Dingle Folk Festival. She has played support slots for the likes of Joey Dosik (Vulfpeck), Moxie, Wyvern Lingo and is a regular special guest with the inimitable Paul Brady having opened for his Irish Tour in late 2017 and now counts him as one of her fans. SÍOMHA’s song ‘July Red Sky’ garnered over 1.7 million views online, and was recorded and performed live from the edge of The Burren, Co Clare. Most recently, SÍOMHA was invited to tour with celebrated contemporary American-Irish group The Olllam, featuring bassist Joe Dart of Vulfpeck. A connection was instantly formed amongst these musicians, and they collaborated together on a version of one of SÍOMHA’s Irish language songs, Craobhacha, creating a beautiful piece of music which perfectly blends the unique sounds of these two artists.

SÍOMHA's music truly does defy any conventional genres. The influences of her musical background, her travels and musical explorations are audible in the music she creates. Always proud of her Irish heritage, she performs her songs in both the English and Irish languages. The beautiful landscape and rugged nature of her native West of Ireland are a huge source of inspiration for this proud Clare artist, leading her to create a soulful and unique style of music that has enthralled anyone who hears it. Her voice transcends musical boundaries, if you haven't yet heard of SÍOMHA, you soon will.:::2607:::443:::0.17054220779220777:::0.4101709401709401:::1:::0:::2017|||"

Terri
Terri Green, Washington D.C native, rose to chart success in 1997, hitting number one in Spain and Italy with her first release, the club hit, Oh La La La, produced by Modern Talking producer Luis Rodriguez. Her work lead to multiple top 100 hits in Germany and abroad, hitting the #1 Spot in the US Billboard Club Songs Chart three times since 2015 under her dance stage name Terri B!. Working alongside a who’s who in dance , either touring, being remixed or collaborating with names like David Guetta, Avicii, Cazzette, Dj Antoine, Bob Sinclair, Roger Sanchez, ATB. She has been recognized as a lengendary songwriter and vocalist in the genre while working with the strongest dance labels in the world, including Sony, Ministry of Sound, Defected, Armada, and Ultra records. Terri was awarded a 50 million plus milestone with her hit single ""Blind Heart"", featuring alongside Swedish superstar producers Cazzette in 2017.

Her songwriting credits include songs for Danish dance queen Medina, German superstar Sarah Connor, Legendary crooner Chris Norman, and has penned more than 1,000 songs since her career began. She has penned music for Universal popstar projects, US Tv hit So You Think You Can Dance, the Originals US tv hit, and Fox’s Pitch series. While signed to Boogie Park in the mid 2000s, her unique voice landed her on Udo Lindenbergs’ Good Life City Lp, as a featured vocalist performing on two songs with him at his request, and joined the German cult deejays the Discoboys as a featured backing singer for Roberto Blanco.

The Terri Green Project
A songwriter for as long as she can remember, the vocalist and producer found her groove with composer, arranger & saxophonist Toddi Reed (Torsten Abrolat), as they joined forces to create a sound that reflected all the genres they loved and grew up with which were no longer present in todays music market. Terri has continusouly earned chart sucess but the feeling of slower, soulful, sexy, charasmatic sounds was a definite invitation to return to the roots. Her warm alto and Torstens’ briliant string arrangements were the key to this charming homeage to some of the worlds greatest musicians and vocalist.

Terri, clearly influenced by names like Donna summer, Barry White, The Ojays, Gladys Knight, Whitney Houston, Motown, and Phyllis Hyman were instrumental in finding the right mixture of then and now. They were not worried whether or not radio would pick up a single because the fans were already saying yes to the groove.

German fans have been growing over the recent years as Terri created her Diamond Night series, which features guest artist and her own original material. Torsten, an avid jazz music lover adds just the right amount swing and pizazz to cleverly constructed soulful titles centered around Terri’s motto of love and happiness. She believes you have only just begun to live past 40 and not to allow anyone to tell you anything different. Legendary songwriter Stephen H. Dorff, composed a soulful passionate ballad for the album, and Johan Boback and Jocke Nilsson of Sweden, who have worked with Celin Dion and the Glee franchise also delivered a stirring lullaby title, which has also become a highlight of the first album, A Soul Dedication.

The first album, A Soul Dedication, was all about love and reconciliation. Give Me One More Chance, the most streamed song of the first album helps bring a love gone wrong back together and back on track. With the next Lp full in production, Terri Green and Toddi Reed have found a magical message and formula for the grown and sexy music lover.:::5908:::973:::0.1271042846042846:::0.3079049654049654:::1:::0:::2018|||"

"770318409:::602274859:::Insert Disk 22:::Insert Disk 22 is a small team of gamers, and most importantly, lovers of point-and-click-adventures, who are trying to both recreate the charm of 80s and 90s adventure games, and deliver them in a manner that is appropriate for the era we all live in. Nostalgia is good, but nostalgia combined with modernity is even better!

ID22's lead is Falko. Falko is 38 years old, and has been a (PC) gamer since 1984, having been introduced to gaming by his father at a very early age. Sierra and LucasArts adventures were some his most early experiences; experiences that partly shaped his life, but most definitely shaped his taste in games. In the 90s, Falko used to develop small freeware games himself, but was drawn into real life too much to make much out of that hobby. Four years ago, Falko closed his business consultancy and translation business of 8 years, to move with (and for) his wife to Australia. Since then, he has taken up streaming games on twitch and making gaming videos on YouTube, which led to him becoming a self-employed content creator within one year. Now though, it is time to move beyond merely playing and criticising games. As the film Ratatouille once said:

""In many ways, the work of a critic is easy. We risk very little yet enjoy a position over those who offer up their work and their selves to our judgement. We thrive on negative criticism, which is fun to write and to read. But the bitter truth we critics must face is that, in the grand scheme of things, the average piece of junk is more meaningful than our criticism designating it so.""

The drive to create instead of consuming is what brought Falko here, to kickstarter. His wish and drive to create a game to add to the hobby that he so adores, will HOPEFULLY entice you too.

Falko is joined by Indrek, an enormously talented (at least Falko thinks so!) graphics artist from Estonia. Indrek has worked on point-and-click titles before, and is blessing Born Punk with his love for both point-and-clicks, and pixel art alike. Previously having been a background artist for the Blackwell Series by WadjetEye Games, Indrek is able to contribute not only with his raw creativity, but also by counseling Falko on the intricacies of game developer life that he has experienced.

Whilst Falko and Indrek are the core team of Insert Disk 22, there are many other people contributing to the development of Born Punk. Jeff Kurtenacker, of Wildstar and World of Warcraft fame, is composing the game's main theme and many of its instrumental tracks. Greetings Program and Javier Morales, both professional musicians, are contributing further tracks to make the sound atmosphere of the game as cyberpunky as it can possibly be. Jean Czarny, an architectural student, is contributing concept art, maps and architectonic advice.

Last but not least, a trusted and motivated core team recruited from Falko's YouTube and twitch channels, is eagerly testing each build of the game, making sure that no pesky bug - or at least as few pesky bugs as possible - are making it through each iteration of the game.

And this, dear ladies and gentlemen, is Insert Disk 22.:::3151:::542:::0.10413855866355867:::0.3899769230769231:::1:::7:::2016|||"

Apart from that within the Creative Force projects we have recorded two promotional CD's for the visually impaired musicians from the Ukraine and Belarus. My next project is to promote the Blind Rock project.
Blind Rock plays a good oldschool Rock music. Technical guitar riffs, melody and composition structure are of high value for the band. It's not correct in the circles of artists to compare, but Megadeth, Dave Mustaine, Pantera, Judas Priest, Victor Smolski, Jason Richardson, Jeff Loomis are indisputable authorities for the musicians from Blind Rock. The music they play is their world's backbone, it makes them live different lives.

I've always had an eye for composition and art, but it wasn't until I first experimented with my grandpa's sewing machine to make an infinity scarf that I realized my love for textiles and fashion. When I was 18 I started an Etsy shop and began selling handmade accessories online. Throughout my years of working for other Leelanau businesses in retail, it became clear that my love for my art and connecting with customers was what I wanted to do for the rest of my life. I attended Kendall College of Art & Design in Grand Rapids, MI where I achieved my BFA in Fashion Studies. My goal through KCAD was to learn more about fashion construction and design to be able to provide high quality products for my customers. It was at KCAD I also discovered my love for textile design and sustainable fashion. After graduation I began working as a designer at a small company in Grand Rapids. After realizing that there's never a good time to start a business, I took the dive. So here I am, trying to fund my first official fashion line.

He then developed the first edition of the Flashe Gaming Glove.

Oskar knew that this was something that could potentially help millions of people around the globe.

"1030023297:::527890759:::Tox Brewing Company:::Hello, we are Mike and Dayne, two lifelong friends from New London County that went to preschool together and have been the best of friends since fifth grade. We have bonded over many shared interests, including craft beer and the nuances of the brewing process. A few years ago we became close friends and bandmates with Jon, a great guy and talented brewer with a few more years of brewing experience than us. Jon quickly became our brewing buddy and partner in crime. We went on to brew together on a regular basis, and when homebrew sessions and events began to outnumber gigs at local bars, we decided to take our hobby more seriously. Dayne, Mike, &amp; Jon pouring at 'Brew With a View' in Middletown, CT in Summer of 2016. Dayne, Mike, & Jon pouring at 'Brew With a View' in Middletown, CT in Summer of 2016. The idea of Tox Brewing started as a daydream between the three of us a few days before Thanksgiving in 2015. We were standing over a converted 10 gallon Igloo cooler stirring hot water into mixed grains. That dream turned into an ongoing conversation, and then a plan, and finally a commercial transition. The two of us have taken the reigns of ownership while Jon continuously brews with us and helps in any way he can. Dayne’s background in Toxicology as well as his interest in poison, antidotes, and plants with natural healing properties have led us to the name and theme for Tox Brewing. We have been slowly realizing process through progress, and are consistently growing as we ponder every style, ingredient, and creation that are new to us. Corey and Lily, The First Ladies of Tox Brewing. Corey and Lily, The First Ladies of Tox Brewing. We are not MBAs, nor are we Venture Capitalists. We are beer nerds and curiosity-filled explorers first and foremost. This endeavor came from a passion and desire to create better and more creative beer, and to continually push our own limits. Tox Brewing Company is Brewer owned and operated, and always will be. We cannot wait to continue to create and even more so, finally share the best beer we know how to make with as many people as possible.

As we immerse ourselves back into the diverse and artistic city of New London, we are looking forward to energizing this town and contributing to its rich history and undeniable culture. With the support of our amazing wives Lily and Corey, and some generous help from family and friends, this dream is being realized more and more every day as we take each step closer to opening our doors.

We welcome you into our modest laboratory to shake our hands, try our beer, give us feedback, and tell us your story... after all, it's probably a lot more interesting than ours.:::2692:::480:::0.19516304347826086:::0.3454375696767001:::1:::3:::2018|||"

"759265949:::1195566536:::Greg Franseth and Chris Grzywacz:::LexiCon and CinCityCon comes from 5 guys who really enjoy playing games and probably own more than 3,000 games between them. We also have enjoyed attending many boardgaming conventions over the years. Greg and Chris founded LexiCon Tabletop Gaming Convention together, in Lexington KY in 2014. LexiCon has grown in attendance and quality over the last 7 years and has been praised frequently for its friendly staff, organized events, and adult gaming parties sponsored by the home town favorite brewery. Both guys bring a love of boardgaming, conventions, and socializing to our conventions. We are very excited to bring LexiCon VI to Lexington again.

We held our first CinCityCon in 2016, a one day event that exceeded our expectations. CinCityCon 2018 saw a turnstile of over 2,000 people attend.

Our first step was to contact Larry Estep, avid gamer and technological whiz to join us. And then we asked one of our most social buddies, Rob Slevin, who has helped make the Lexington area gamers Meetup exceed over 1,500 people! Greg Franseth is well known in the gaming community for his gaming expertise, The former Boardgame PirateCast (podcast), being incredibly friendly, his love of trivia, and his huge personal gaming library of over 1,700 games, which he is willing to share with convention attendees. He also founded the Lexington Gaming Enthusiasts Meetup group.

Chris Grzywacz is known for his enjoyment of popular games and gaming conventions, his daughters who regularly dominate games they play, and his wife who thinks he is a Big Old Nerd (but not so big if you have seen him lately). He spends a lot of his free time working on CinCityCon and LexiCon, when he is not playing co-ops, deck builders, biking, or reading.

Larry Estep loves table-top gaming in all its forms. He began playing RPGs in the early 1980s, has made forays into miniatures gaming, and has become an avid fan of board games. The core of his regular gaming group has been together for over 30 years. Due to this, he hasn’t always gotten out much, but he’s trying to correct that by working with LexiCon and CinCityCon where he coordinates tournaments, RPGs and miniatures events.

Rob Slevin has been hard at work to grow the Learn to Play events at LexiCon and CinCityCon. He has been working on building his personal library of games which he often shares at one of the many local gaming events he coordinates, and is known as the current face of the Boardgame Enthusiasts of Lexington (KY), a group started by Greg Franseth.

Due to the incredible success of LexiCon, we decided to expand. After Greg moved to Cincinnati, it was easy to decide where the next convention should be. So we invited board game insider and operator of Charleston, West Virginia's CharCon, Travis Reynolds, to join us and we started up CinCityCon, Cincinnati’s largest boardgame and RPG convention, happening every October at the Sharonville Convention Center just off I-75 north of Cincinnati.:::2978:::504:::0.17673913043478262:::0.39756131549609813:::9:::80:::2012|||"

"2042653727:::1388604681:::Michenoelle Provence:::My name is Michenoelle Provence, the founder of Limitless Movement. I’m a professional dancer for over 19 years in Salsa, Afro and Contemporary Dance. I’ve shared my passion of dance in over 45 countries, teaching in over 175 salsa congresses worldwide. I was living the dream of an artist you can say. No, I wasn’t. But I didn’t know that yet. In 2014 I hit “rock bottom”. I lost my purpose as a dancer. Arts, what always have been a safe haven for me became a burden. I felt stuck. I operated in an entertainment scene but I wasn’t interested in making someone laugh. I want a dialog with the audience and with my students, an emotional connection. I am very grateful for all the chances received all these years from promoters to expose my arts, for students for their trust, but nonetheless, I felt stuck. What I was practicing, what I was perceiving, wasn’t me anymore. With help of great mentors, I somehow got back on track, that’s what I thought at least. Getting new perceptions but still exercising them in the same place became even more of a burden. It tore my soul apart. While being in this dark place, still traveling, performing and teaching all over the world, I got exposed. I was in Cape Town, South Africa at that time, teaching an Afro Movement Workshop at the MZansi Cape Town Salsa Festival and almost at the end of the workshop a student asked me a question which made me feel naked! Exposed. She asked: Can you move instinctively for us? BOOM! At that moment I got confronted with the fact that everything that I was doing up till this very moment was a lie. I put a song on and started moving. I felt fear in Motion for the first minute, and then all of a sudden, I felt a warmth, I felt a connection, I felt safe. I couldn’t identify this moment. 4 months after this I watched a documentary on IDO Portal - Just Move, which changed my life. The 19 years of experience in all of these techniques in dance got me stuck in just one perception of dance or movement and it made me realize that there is so much more. I had to de-attach myself from all the knowledge and the image that was attached to that knowledge and completely rewire myself to focus on what truly really amazed me: Movement. I had to explore. I had to accept, that I had all this knowledge of all these techniques, but I had not much of a clue of movement. And therefore I could never connect to my own identity. Then I founded Limitless Movement, a method that fuses all the techniques that I’ve trained, but shapeless, borderless to have a much greater purpose: connect people to their inner landscape, to their best version through movement. It saved my life. I turned my back to my old career in the salsa scene, where I was very successful with a dance studio and all of that. It wasn’t my dream and purpose anymore. So I moved to a different country, clueless, without a plan. But re-energized after being depressed for over 3 years.

After recording several demos that would introduce his body of work to various audiences, he began to record and release his self-titled debut in 2008 followed by his alt-country tinged 2013 sophomore release, Odd Man Out. His songs have been featured in several independent films and performed in some of the more well-known venues across the state of Texas.

"2052008082:::1879284926:::ALBERTO MENDEZ BARROSO:::Me llamo Alberto, soy Especialista en Policía Científica del Cuerpo Nacional de Policía, me licencié en Criminología, en la Universidad de Alicante, pero antes ya había acabado el Título Superior en Ciencias Criminológicas de la Universidad de Las Palmas de G.C. Y es realmente aquí, sobre los años 1995 - 2000, cuando empezó a gestarse la idea de este proyecto. En estos momentos y con motivo del proyecto ANGEL CUSTODIO me encuentro cursando un Máster Oficial de programación avanzada para aplicaciones en terminales móviles por la Universidad UOC.

Pasé todas mis prácticas en una Oficina de Asistencia a Las Víctimas del Delito( Sin duda fue un proceso de concienciación y de sensibilización sobre la problemática de la violencia en el ámbito familiar que me ha marcado para el resto de mi vida), que por aquel entonces era una idea novedosa e innovadora en la que un criminólogo integraría todos los conocimientos necesarios para gestionar y coordinar una ayuda verdadera, eficaz y multifactorial para que la víctima de una vez por todas tuviera su lugar en los hechos delictivos, que comenzara a ser realmente nuestro centro de atención, el origen desde donde se empieza a abordar todas las fases del delito. Como digo, una visión innovadora y diferente que me sedujo y me hizo desarrollar ideas, fruto de las experiencias relatadas por las víctimas que asistía cada día en la OAVD, ideas de cómo abordar un problema de extrema gravedad que aumenta cada año y que causa tanto daño... Los malos tratos en el ámbito familiar.

Escuchar las numerosas y desgarradoras experiencias sufridas por las víctimas de malos tratos, me llevó a realizar mi TESIS, justamente sobre todo lo que había vivido esos años, la Tesis ""Aproximación teórica y análisis criminológico de una caso de malos tratos producido en el ámbito de la pareja"" me llevó a profundizar definitivamente sobre estas experiencias que solo las víctimas que lo sufren saben lo duras y difíciles que son de afrontar, pero no solo durante la agresión que es el momento donde se exterioriza la violencia(Fase Estallido de la tensión, (Leonore Walker)), y donde hasta ahora hemos centrado la atención para iniciar los protocolos de actuación y el procedimiento judicial posterior, sino durante todo el proceso tanto en las fases de ""Acumulación de tensión"" como en la fase de ""Luna de miel o arrepentimiento"". Estas otras fases del ciclo de violencia sufrido por las víctimas, son vividas en la soledad, en la desesperación, esperando que llegue de nuevo ese momento que posibilita dar el primer paso a la justicia, y con la impotencia de no poder hacer nada hasta entonces.

Tras terminar esta primera parte de mis estudios como Criminólogo, tenía claro cual era mi lugar, desde donde desarrollar todas estas ideas, desde donde trabajar para contribuir con soluciones para las víctimas de los malos tratos con los conocimientos y experiencias vividas a lo largo de la carrera, y desde donde obtener las herramientas para llevar a cabo mi aportación a todas ellas... Ser Policía, que mejor lugar para desarrollar todo esto que rondaba en mi cabeza ya desde los comienzos de mis estudios y que ha estado ahí todo este tiempo.

Ingresé en el Cuerpo Nacional de Policía en el 2002, y desde el primer día me di cuenta que no iba a resultar fácil. Desde allí te van asignando destinos y trabajos que nada tenían que ver con lo que tenía en mente antes de entrar. Se me presentaba otro reto, y era conseguir un lugar, una oportunidad, un hueco en la policía, alguien que escuchara o atendiera sobre la posibilidad de realizar un proyecto que ayudara a paliar este mal de violencia que se propaga cada vez mas.
Y esa oportunidad, 16 años después surgió. Me presenté a una convocatoria de la Fundación de la Policía española, para la concesión de becas para Proyectos de Investigación de la Policía Nacional, y sobre finales de Julio de este año, recibí una llamada donde me daban la enhorabuena por haber ganado la Beca por haber sido elegido el proyecto, y me animaba a terminarlo y a llevarlo a cabo. Por fin vi la luz, es el empujoncito que necesitaba para volver a creer en que este proyecto puede nacer, y que puede estar en manos de todas y cada una de las personas que lo necesiten, y lo mas importante, puede ayudarlas, y en un momento dado, salvarles la vida.

Este proyecto comienza como respuesta efectiva y eficaz a esta fase crítica donde se pone en peligro su integridad física y su vida, pero se proyecta mas allá de esta fase tal y como veremos mas adelante, porque el proyecto Angel Custodio condiciona e interviene durante todo el ciclo de violencia, previniendo durante la fase de ""Acumulación de Tensión"" (Prevención General que provoca la intimidación del agresor al pensar que puede estar ""vigilado"" por ""Angel Custodio""), durante la fase de Estallido de la Tensión (Prevención secundaria que actúa generando una serie de recursos inmediatos para poner fin a la situación de violencia) y durante la fase de la Luna de Miel (Prevención Especial dotando de los medios de prueba necesarios para introducirlos en el atestado o denuncia posterior que lleve al agresor al cumplimiento de la pena).:::5175:::874:::0.1:::0.16:::1:::0:::2018|||"

He is a part-time artist and inventor, and his Original PaceWheel (a distance runner’s training-pace calculator) is in use by athletes and coaches in more than in all 50 states (plus Puerto Rico and Guam), in 85 countries, and on all 7 continents, so he knows a thing or two about bringing major projects to life, planning for complex distribution, and dealing with international shipping issues.

Michael plays acoustic guitar, wears artsy and clever neckties, has strong—and occasionally informed—opinions about film, and believes that the designated hitter is a blight on the beauty of the game.:::1070:::170:::0.11528535353535352:::0.3982222222222222:::5:::9:::2014|||"

She is involved in Research and Project Development at the University of the Sunshine Coast, Australia and her professional practice is in co-creating preferred community futures across the globe.

Families learn together with topics like awareness, resilience, connection, gratitude, cultivating a life-long love of learning, and so much more!

She sees clients, working with people to help bring their health back into balance through the use of herbs, lifestyle and dietary changes. Since 2003, she has taught classes locally, out of her home, and at conferences around the country. She has coordinated and taught kid’s camp classes at herbal conferences throughout the country as well as hosted classes for kids in her own back yard. She also enjoys teaching adults and has presented at conferences around the country and in her home. She loves to teach others how to illustrate plants and how to use plant illustration as a tool for botanical identification as well as a starting point to an intimate relationship with plants, especially when combined with organoleptic experiences. For the past 10 years, she has written and illustrated the award winning ezine, Herbal Roots zine, a monthly publication which teaches herbalism through songs, stories, crafts, recipes and games, each issue focusing on a single herb. Herbal Roots zine began as a curriculum for her own children to teach them about the medicinal uses of plants when she started homeschooling and discovered that the options for teaching kids about herbs was really limited. It gave her an excuse to combine two of her favorite passions - drawing and herbalism - together to create the future world’s assets (the children) the importance of the plants that grow all around us. Though HRz is written for children, many of her customers purchase the online zine for their own use. Over 110 issues have been written to date. She lives with her partner and their 2 youngest children on a farmette in southwest Illinois, along with their 4 cats, 2 dogs, 3 goats and 18ish chickens.:::1849:::310:::0.10695970695970695:::0.24496336996336995:::1:::18:::2010|||"

Inventist is based in Camas, WA and lead by founder, president and inventor, Shane Chen. A true inventor and tinkerer since he was young, in 1986 his passion for inventing guided him to relocate to the U.S. Chen's entrepreneurial spirit led him to start his own company, CID (Chen Instrument Design) http://cid-inc.com/ which dedicated to making instruments for agricultural research. Still, Chen had ideas about fun activities that just didn't blend with photosynthesis research. So in 2003 Chen founded Inventist, Inc. Chen was finally able to follow his imagination, blending his unique ability to invent with his love of sports and fitness. He's even invented/designed some home and kitchen products. In his free time Chen speed skates, windsurfs, snowboards, swims and Aquaskips!

Working with light and creating the associated moods fascinates me. In my work I am very perfectionist and try to always achieve the best result with my means. This always creates unique, expressive and touching images.
I was born in 1973. Even as a little boy I was fascinated by the old photographs of my parents and grandparents. The first pictures I made with the old AGFA box camera of my father. I was always on the lookout for new motives worth capturing. My passion has been rekindled over and over again on my many international trips. It still makes me very much fun to capture special moods and impressions that you can remember when looking at the picture again and again. Because without photography the moment is lost forever! I used the last years to train myself in the field of photography. I have repeatedly attended courses and workshops with renowned photographers. Among others, Oliver Bader, Michael Schnabel and Werner Harrer in the Linz Photo School. In doing so, I discovered my love for portrait photography. Because I find it interesting to capture particular moods, emotions or stories in a picture. So every photo becomes a unique memory.:::1292:::223:::0.2145186988936989:::0.3210918710918711:::1:::0:::2018|||"

I spent over 10 years working with Kunt and the Gang, probably the internet's rudest musical comedy act, who built up a loyal online following with their ludicrously smutty songs and the videos we made together, whilst touring the UK regularly until 2016. In this time Kunt and the Gang had over 3 million YouTube hits despite having their channel shut down, scored two of the least appropriately titled top 75 UK hit singles of all time, were ostracised by the Edinburgh Fringe comedy community over a misjudged advertising campaign involving stickers of crudely drawn penises, and organised the world’s first ever virtual dirty protest where literally tens of people tweeted jpegs of their faecal excrement to evil entertainment bigwig Simon Cowell.

"578294926:::1050687500:::Jens Ole Miang:::The story of Miang Copenhagen begins with a young boy receiving a fine Seiko chronograph watch from his father, who had just returned home from the World Expo in Osaka, Japan. The mechanical watch made a great impression on the boy, sowing the seeds of what would grow into a passion for watches.
Founder Jens Ole Miang has now spent more than 20 years working with watches as corporate gifts, supplying countless customized logo watches to companies around the world. As a watch enthusiast and collector, Jens Ole Miang’s work has always been accompanied by an unwavering dedication to each individual watch. He travels far and wide to experience original pieces first hand, staying at the forefront of the latest trends and witnessing every detail up close.

Miang’s deep professional and passionate insight into the universe of watches led him to wonder why people did not have the option of designing their own watches.
By founding Miang Copenhagen, Jens Ole Miang set out to provide such an opportunity for other watch enthusiasts. His knowledge of the industry and direct contact with quality suppliers around the world has eliminated the need for costly middlemen and made such watches possible at a reasonable price.:::1228:::206:::0.1947916666666667:::0.5252083333333333:::3:::3:::2015|||"

"884857214:::786223598:::Ich sehe die Sonne e.V.:::Die Gründungsversammlung für unseren Verein „Ich sehe die Sonne“ fand am 19. April 2013 in Zwickau statt. Am 14. Mai 2013 erfolgte die Eintragung beim Amtsgericht Chemnitz unter der Registernummer VR 2961. Der Verein bestand zunächst aus sieben Gründungsmitgliedern, davon drei Vorstände (1. und 2. Vorsitzende/r sowie Kassiererin). Zweck des Vereins ist die Förderung von Kunst und Kultur sowie die Förderung internationaler Gesinnung, der Toleranz auf allen Gebieten der Kultur und des Völkerverständigungsgedankens.
Unsere erste Projektentwicklung war die Produktion einer eigenen TV-Serie mit Kindern und Jugendlichen unter gleichem Namen wie der Verein (Ich sehe die Sonne). Das Konzept sah vor, dass die bei einem Casting zuvor ausgewählten Kids ihre Drehbücher selbst schreiben und ihre Rollen in Eigenregie entwickeln. Dabei wurden sie von einer erfahrenen Schauspielerin und Regisseurin angeleitet. Die Planung, Proben und einige Drehtermine fanden damals in den Räumlichkeiten des Jugendclubs „CityPoint“ in Zwickau statt. Der Verein bedankt sich an dieser Stelle nochmals ausdrücklich für die von der Stadtverwaltung, namentlich dem damaligen Leiter des „CityPoints“, Jörn Küttler, gegebene Möglichkeit. Weiterhin wurden uns Räumlichkeiten und das Gelände der „Humboldtschule“ kostenlos als Drehort zur Verfügung gestellt, wofür wir uns ebenfalls bei den damals Verantwortlichen, insbesondere Herrn Direktor Weber, bedanken.
Innerhalb eines Jahres entstand so ein kompletter Jugendfilm. Die Idee einer Serie mussten wir leider aufgeben. Die Kids veränderten sich sehr schnell, beendeten ihre Schulzeit, gingen zum Studium oder zur Arbeit, einige zogen auch weg. Trotzdem war es eine sehr schöne Zeit, in der das Gemeinschaftsgefühl der Kids gestärkt wurde. Sie wurden angeregt selbstständig zu denken und zu handeln. Ihre Disziplin und Konzentrationsfähigkeit verbesserte sich durch die Aufmerksamkeit während der Dreharbeiten. Alles in allem entstand eine positive Gruppendynamik, die nicht nur die Kinder und Jugendlichen in ihrer Persönlichkeitsentwicklung voran brachte, sondern auch uns Vereinsmitglieder durch vielfältige Erfahrungen bereicherte.
Mit der Anerkennung der Gemeinnützigkeit vom 6. Juni 2017 sind wir nun auch berechtigt, öffentliche Fördergelder zu beantragen. Dadurch eröffnen sich für uns ganz neue Möglichkeiten der Projektplanung, -entwicklung und -durchführung. Für das kommende Jahr 2019 liegen bereits mehrere Vorschläge seitens der Mitglieder vor, die wir mit Hilfe kommunaler Förderung und anderer Zuwendungen umsetzen wollen. Höhepunkt wird die Anime-Convention der Jugendinitiative „JACKT“ im Sommer 2019 sein, die wir als Verein mit organisieren und unterstützen werden. Ein schlüssiges Gesamtkonzept ist gerade im Entstehen und wird bis zum Stichtag im August 2018 rechtzeitig eingereicht. Einige weitere Beispiele sind im Folgenden aufgeführt:

	Jugend TV-Serie
	Offene Bühne
	Theaterprojekte für Menschen mit besonderen Lebensumständen
	Mal- und Zeichenkurse
	Anime Kostüm-Werkstatt
	K-Pop Tanzworkshop for Kids
	Lesungen, Vorträge und Aufführungen von Künstlern für interessiertes Publikum

...und einiges mehr.

Zu diesem Zweck benötigen wir perspektivisch eigene Räumlichkeiten, die wir anmieten wollen. Auch dafür benötigen wir finanzielle Unterstützung.

"673308349:::533239340:::Justin Kaleb Driggers:::Let me open up by saying thank you for visiting this page, it means a lot to me that you did. I grew up in the Arkansas Ozarks, but moved to Nashville, Tennessee when I was 22. Soon after, I went down to Muscle Shoals, Alabama and recorded my first full-length album “Homesick Blues” with the great Jimmy Nutt and Gary Nichols (The Steeledrivers) and signed a publishing deal with Edenspeak Publishing. I was a young green horn with starry eyes, but quickly realized the difficulty and sacrifice the music industry brings. After 5 years and more rejections that I can count, I moved back to Arkansas to catch my breath and try my hand at a new market; then of course the inevitable happened.

After a year of working the Texas and Oklahoma markets, Nashville came calling again. I found myself back in my old stompin’ grounds regularly playing shows and writing music. I partnered up with my old pal Darren King (Project 86/The Overseer) and the demos we were working on quickly turned into a record.

I’m proud of these songs. They mean a lot to me. I cover a lot of ground on this record, from the foster system and abandonment, to death and a blue-collar workday. I’m related in one form or another to each character in these songs. Maybe it’s from growing up in the folklore-enriched Ozarks, or maybe it’s simply from hearing Willie Nelson’s “Red Headed Stanger” at a vulnerable age. Maybe it’s both, or neither. But it is what it is, and I’m proud of it nonetheless. The reason why I’m crowd funding this record instead of going through a record label is simply so I can keep 100% control over my music. When you buy my record through this website, the money goes directly to the making of this record. It pays for production, album artwork, and digital promotion. This isn’t a handout or a bait-and-switch; it’s simply you buying a product earlier than everyone else so the record can get made. For you, it costs the same. For me, it’s make or break. I love what I do. It’s a weird way to live, but it’s a life worth living. It really does take a village, and I’m honored that you chose to be a part of it.

The first game console I ever owned was an NES, gifted to me by my parents, and needless to say, I was hooked. For me, games are a great way to unwind, and have an uncanny ability to pull you into their worlds. As a developer with a passion for developing mobile apps, I have worked on and overseen the creation of multiple apps at a digital agency that I work for. Outside of my full-time job, I’ve also worked on a couple personal projects, including Mr. Pew, an iOS game, and Thirrrsty, an iOS app for tracking water intake. My latest project is Questlii, a mobile application that combines my love for games with goal-tracking. By combining the reward system that games utilize with a practical use-case, self-improvement can be made easier for anyone and everyone.:::910:::166:::0.125462962962963:::0.27037037037037037:::1:::0:::2013|||"

However, the production of a video media through 3D rendered figures in multi-language consists of many components and efforts. The scheduled time-line for the launch of the show has been planned as well as possible from the experience we have, along with consultation with a number of external parties, therefore the schedules cannot always be guaranteed. We will stay in constant communication with you to keep you up to date and informed on our progress.

We already have all of the connections to and prior discussions with the required sources in order to execute this project, but the total pledge gathered will determine	whether or not to carry out the project. If the pledge sum raised for our project in Kickstarter does not reach our minimum goal of 10 million yen, the project will be terminated and all purchase amounts will be refunded. On the other hand if we receive enough funding between the two crowdfunding projects to have multiple characters debut on the show, due to the resources available and time constraints, please have understanding for that we will most likely not be able to debut all characters at once, and will complete one character at a time. In regards the pledge reward goods, the delivery date will vary depending on the shipping location.

The record portrays a heavier side of production compared to his debut single, “Whiskey” he released earlier that year. After touring the album, doing some traveling, living a little, and looking from the outside in, he now longs for that simplicity once again.

We continually work on renewing and developing ourselves and our musical expression. However, we always return to our core of atmospheric pop in image-creating acappella arrangements.

Vokalkompagniet består af 20 dygtige, engagerede og solidt samsungne sangere og er kendetegnet ved sin store musikalitet og sit sceniske nærvær. Vi har base i København, og har gennem de sidste 21 år sunget en lang række koncerter, både i Danmark og i udlandet. Vi afholder koncerter med fuldt kor, men tager også ud i mindre besætninger til diverse jobs - både med og uden dirigent.

Vores musikalitet spænder vidt; vi har bl.a. fordybet os i den nordiske musikskat, country og bluegrass, moderne popklassiskere, swingjazz og meget mere. Koret har dermed et omfattende og varieret bagkatalog, og søger hele tiden ny inspiration og inspirerende legekammerater. Vi samarbejder jævnligt med forskellige eksterne gæstelærere. Senest Phillip Faber, Terese Damsholt, Jens Johansen og Jesper Holm. Vi har ligeledes flere samarbejdspartnere i udlandet. Vi arbejder kontinuerligt med at forny og udvikle os selv og vores musikalske udtryk. Vi vender dog altid tilbage til vores egen hjertelyd af stemningsfuld pop i billedskabende a cappella-arrangementer.:::1845:::282:::-0.012752525252525262:::0.18820145903479235:::1:::0:::2018|||"

Shy and fearful about her ability to sing when a child, Johnsen kept her obsession with finding the perfect harmonies to herself until her early 20's. Like a whirlwind, she suddenly found herself cast into the national spotlight in 2012 when she captivated American Idol Season 11 viewers making it all the way through to the Top 24 semifinals before conceding. Haley has since been utilizing the steam from this experience and making waves throughout the West Coast Region as an independent singer-songwriter performing songs from her debut EP, Through the Blue. Haley is currently in the process of writing and recording her second EP with her Portland based band.:::1024:::174:::0.10277777777777779:::0.3326388888888889:::2:::7:::2010|||"

The dream is to create our performances like a dinner invite; each bringing different ingredients and each proposing their unique recipes, for then to cook together and once more gather around the table, sharing new flavours. The day after whilst washing the dishes left to soak out of tiredness, a feeling of happiness lingers thinking about the most beautiful evening. -------

Both with other full-time careers, we set up Teesloth to collaborate in our spare time to create something fun, playful and joyful—but also ethical.

Once we'd settled on our theme and name (we love sloths—who doesn't love sloths?) we realised it was an absolute no-brainer that we should donate a portion of the profit to a sloth conservation charity. By doing this, we felt maybe our business could make some kind of positive (albeit small) impact in the world, rather than being purely for our own benefit. We now send £1 for every item sold to the Sloth Conservation Foundation, who do amazing things to protect and research sloth life.:::940:::159:::0.3219016697588127:::0.6658225108225108:::1:::1:::2014|||"

"71708424:::515836670:::Kymbr Mundstock:::When I was a kid I played role-playing games. Sitting at a table, rolling dice while the game master lead us in a tale of adventure and intrigue. I enjoyed the escape into that fantasy world for even a few hours per week. But real life, family and school didn't allow that escape to go on as long as I would have liked. I went to camps occasionally, and I had fun, but they usually had a focus that wasn't exactly mine. I didn't enjoy exercise for its own sake. I didn't make friends easily with the ultra-religious delighting in the wonders of God's creation or the adrenaline junkies who conquered mountains for bragging rights. Why struggle so hard to get up just to waste nearly as much time and effort to get back down. Fighting my way up to save a prisoner, defeat a villain or even just get information seemed a better motivation.
As I grew older I got into costuming and visited renaissance fairs. I ran children's at a reigonal science fiction convention for many years. I taught kids of all ages in many subjects in childcare centers, afterschool care and homeschool co-ops. I was a scout leader and a tutor before I got my BA in Education. I write fantasy and light sci-fi books for young adults and sell crafts at local shows and conventions.:::1255:::235:::0.1965873015873016:::0.39254960317460313:::1:::0:::2018|||"

I became a qualified personal trainer by 2011 and since then I started to learn the characteristics of Gym goers I.e. what keeps them motivated, how they feel when they achieve their results and their competitive spirit. I would speak to a crowd of fitness individuals about some ideas I had and quickly realised that people would take interest and begin to debate on the best way for the idea to work. To me, I quickly realised that my fitness ideas sparked interest in the minds of fitness lovers.

She won a Golden Gate Award at the San Francisco International Film Festival for her short film Lost & Found, and was the recipient of a Princess Grace Award in film. Natalija is a graduate of the UCLA MFA screenwriting program where she was awarded the Executive Board Award Fellowship and was one of eight writers selected to work with Academy Award-winning screenwriter Dustin Lance Black in a feature screenwriting seminar. She researched and wrote Jane, which was subsequently invited to participate in the Film Independent Screenwriting Lab and selected as an honoree in the Writers Guild of America West's Feature Access Diversity Project. A short documentary she co-directed about Pauline Kael, Ed & Pauline, premièred at the Telluride Film Festival and a short portrait of Academy Award nominated filmmaker Sam Green is currently streaming on Adobe Create Magazine. Natalija is Bosnian and Serbian and immigrated to Chicago when she was six years old. She’s convinced that not being able to speak English didn’t just ostracize her from her classmates, but taught her to be a keen observer and sparked her love of storytelling. Dreaming up stories was a way to regain her voice and make sense of her new home. Natalija writes and adapts screenplays for film and television about true or historic events from the perspective of outsiders, misfits and women who shape history, but are often forgotten.

"584932310:::461340716:::Jan Morris (Janet Elizabeth):::I live in Brisbane Australia, I am a Christian, and my husband and I have been married since 1990. We have a son. I love having fun getting together with friends. I love reading, the movies and eating out.
I started writing in my journal shortly after I became a Christian in 2011, the questions and discussions came out in rhyme and I was encouraged by my lovely girlfriends to publish the poems in a little book. Sometimes God prompts me to share certain poems with specific people and it always seems to be a word especially for them straight from heaven.
I felt that God wanted me to create a set of 4 rhyming versions of well love parables and I completed 'The Good Samaritan' in January 2018. The second book 'The Prodigal Son' is written and illustrated, but not yet in print. That, I hope, is where all you lovely people come in.
I wanted to create a way to bring my friends, family, supporters and other Christians, together on this joint project of releasing 4 books in The Parables of Jesus Collection.
I have self-funded the first one (and 2 other books too) but I want to keep going each time I get a prompting from God for another book.
Let’s gather together and get these wonderful stories out to the children of today and give them a strong grounding in the simple lessons of how to be a wonderful friend, to believe in themselves and their talents, to understand the importance of forgiveness and to know they are loved beyond measure. All the glory goes to God because I truly believe that He writes and illustrates for me....I'm really not that good!:::1574:::290:::0.25093469030969034:::0.4168360805860806:::1:::0:::2018|||"

If you go to a bbq and Brice's you can count on having an AR light saber in your hand, or being forced into the cockpit of the latest and greatest VR shooter, flight sim, horror trope, ect...

Brice has run big and small businesses, from technologically intensive research based services to the number 1 ice cream store in the southern US. Merging smiles and tech comes second nature to him so creating an entertainment venue that merges these ideals is just a natural evolution of already established skills and experience. From me, (Brice) to all of you true believers out there, HADO is a great foundation for what is coming. Snowcrash, Ready Player One, and the like are not that far off.

"288923957:::1821399542:::A. Pat Britten:::A’len P. Britten was born and raised on the South Side of Chicago. As the seventh of ten children, there is much to say about her childhood, but it’s her experience as a mother, she claims, that overshadow all those earlier encounters. Motherhood gave her the inspiration to go back to college to complete her degree in education and to write her first play. During her matriculation, many of her professors took note of her work and encouraged Britten to seek a degree in writing—at that time, one was permitted to teach with a bachelor’s degree; with that in mind, she pursued professional technical writing with a concentration in creative writing and a minor in music. After obtaining her B. A. at Chicago State University, she began teaching music and drama at Percy L. Julian High School. When the tides turned, and she could no longer teach with just a B. A., she redirected her focus on writing. Before completing her degree, Britten fulfilled an internship at Third World Press Publishing Company on Chicago’s South Side; after which she self-published her first novel, When Does Hell End? and within months sold over a thousand copies. This novel was written in conjunction with her stage play, MaMa’s Place. Following the advice of the Editor at Third-World Press, she rewrote the story in first person; the rewrite led to a three-part series and was released through Divinity Book Press Publishing Company in the Spring of 2008. In later years, part 4: An Unusual Storm, and part 5: Storm of All Storms of that series was then released. This five-part series remain in circulation today. In addition to the series, she has added to her collection of stage plays: Something’s in the Vineyard, This Thing Called Love, Finding a Good Thing, 20.5 Million Dollars, Saving Charlie and A Town’s Hero along with many, many scores of musical pieces.

Although much of her time has been devoted to writing, her passion for singing has not been pushed aside. At the age of 19, she recorded her first solo, “I’ve Got The Victory,” with Rev. Calvin Bridges and the Faith Tabernacle Choir. In subsequent years, she began singing and traveling with BET’s gospel show host, Dr. Bobby Jones and other major gospel artist; during the grand opening of Nashville’s International Airport, she was given the opportunity to sing before thousands—the doors quickly opened from that event. While pursing her Master’s in English and Education at Governors State University, in October of 2013, she won the title of GSU Idol. Although she has a strong passion for both writing and singing, her love for children is even greater. And so, she found her way back into the classrooms. It was during her five-year stint at Thornridge High School when she discovered her true purpose. She now gives her undivided attention to a program that she has developed for the youth and young adults in the Chicago land area that allows them to flourish in areas beyond their core classes.

"1521761483:::1310018462:::Nick Davis:::Nick Davis is an Englishman currently living on the East Coast of the USA, not too far removed from Baltimore.

Growing up Nick was an avid reader of comic books and could be found regularly buried in a copy of Warlord, Battle, Action, 2000AD, The Beano, Chipper or Rupert the Bear. Truthfully, you can still find him today with his feet up nose buried in a comic. An avid fantasy/sci-fi novel reader and counts the Discworld Novels, Starship Troopers, Wind in the Willows and the Lord of the Rings as his favorite books.

His writing career really began in the late 1990's while working for Games Workshop, he was given the opportunity to write for their Monthly Gaming Magazine White Dwarf; a job he tackled with gusto much to the horror of the Magazines Copy Editor. Nowadays he is still a content creator and writer, but is also a skilled web and graphic designer, sometimes artist, jack of all trades and a dedicated father.

He is married to a very patient Irish American Lady, and has three grown children. When he isn't working, running errands, walking the dogs or digging through an ever growing list of 'honey do' projects, Nick can be found plodding away on a keyboard or picking up a pencil to explore the world of wonder and imagination.:::1257:::223:::0.1296875:::0.5070913461538462:::17:::38:::2011|||"

"703813867:::410993770:::Jamie Ferguson:::Jamie Ferguson is a percussive acoustic guitarist based in Salford, UK; his musical approach combines percussive techniques, fingerpicking and inventive harmonics to achieve a unique style. After releasing his EP ‘Epoch’ back in March 2018, Jamie sparked label interest from Fret Monkey Records, releasing two music videos on their platform as a guest artist, one of which pulled in over 25,000 views. Jamie has worked in and around Manchester at gigs where the reception has always been one of excitement to see a percussive guitarist live. He has also supported Mike Dawes and Luca Stricagnoli, as well as performing for Sofar Manchester, Edinburgh and Harrogate respectively. In September of this year, Jamie headed to Poland to partake in the International Guitar Festival where he was able to perform and to sell copies of his EP. Jamie is by means a small player in the guitar scene, gaining merit from accomplished artists, with Jon Gomm pinpointing Jamie’s style as ‘pure adrenaline, both visceral and exciting’; whilst Mike Dawes also shares this admiration; 'Jamie is a great player with a wonderful tone and an ear for arranging!’
Jamie is currently hoping to start work on the creation of his double concept EP, Yin/Yang, which blends together his fingerstyle influences in one half, and his step into the influences of the modern pop world in the other.

I have always been involved with tabletop wargaming and RPG throughout my life, and recently wondered how to bring my love of wargaming and building 3D assets together.
With the rapid development and the falling prices of the home desktop 3D printer making 3D printing more accessible, this has opened up an opportunity for me to create objects and buildings for my battles and adventures. I believe that terrain and props can play such an important role in the wargame/RPG story. This has led me to launch Dark Realms Forge. My aim is to develop a range of miniatures, terrain, and props to bring extra life to your RPG and tabletop wargames.

Chose peu surprenante quand on est la petite-fille de Paul et Berthilde Daoust, une ardente famille franco-ontarienne originaire d'Embrun. Mais détrompez-vous, son père William, anglophone et francophile passioné, en est pour quelque chose aussi! (Malgré le fait qu'à la petite école à Vancouver, il épelait le mot ""virgule"" durant la dictée, William devint un bilingue français des plus accomplis après s'être épris de Thérèse dans sa vingtaine!) Quoi qu’il en soit, on peut compter sur le long métrage EAUX TROUBLES/ BROKEN WATERS pour nous présenter une toile de fond bilingue complètement réaliste.

Quant à son amour de la nature, Karolyne l’incorpore à Nos eaux glacées en faisant appel aux scènes silencieuses des films asiatiques The Scent of Green Papaya et Ju Dou.

À ce jour, sa quête constante d’un équilibre entre sa passion pour les sciences et les arts de la scène imprègne son quotidien. Cette quête, et parfois ce déchirement, rappelle la difficulté qu’éprouve Marguerite, personnage au coeur de Nos eaux glacées, à établir un équilibre entre sa vie personnelle et sa carrière.

Au cours des ans, Karolyne a été comédienne tant sur scène que sur des plateaux de tournage de cinéma et de télévision. Son plus récent rôle fut celui de Sylvie dans Mon corps deviendra froid, pièce de théâtre d’Anne-Marie Olivier montée par Les Indisciplinés de Toronto en novembre 2013.

Karolyne a acquis ses connaissances en production cinématographique en participant à plusieurs ateliers à Montréal, Ottawa et Toronto offerts par le Canadian Screen Training Centre. Karolyne mis ses connaissances en pratique lorsqu’elle produit la bande-annonce de Nos eaux glacées sur 35mm avec un devis de $44,000 et une équipe de 19 personnes.

_________

Not surprisingly, the key elements of EAUX TROUBLES/ BROKEN WATERS happen to give a pretty good snapshot of who Karolyne is. Like the main character's struggle to maintain both a personal and professional life, Karolyne’s pull between her artistic and scientific career goals is a life-long quest for balance. The film's cultural backdrop reflects her own heritage, having a francophone mother from Embrun, just outside of Ottawa, and an Anglophone (and passionate Francophile) father from Vancouver. The visual aspect of the film reflects her love of nature and appreciation for the visual serenity of Asian dramatic cinema. Last but no least, Karolyne cares deeply about the topic of psychiatric health care, and the impacts of psychotropic prescription drugs (good and bad) at the individual and societal level. Over the years, Karolyne has acted in theatrical, television and film productions in French and English in four different cities. Her most recent role was in a 2013 stage production of Mon corps deviendra froid, a drama by the French-Canadian playwright Anne-Marie Olivier, in Toronto.

She learnt film production principles through a number of courses offered by the Canadian Film Training Centre, from 2002 to 2006. These were solidified through the practical experience of producing the trailer for EAUX TROUBLES/ BROKEN WATERS, which she produced with a $44,000 budget and the support of 19 cast, crew and creative team members.

"1416393039:::129487580:::WILLIAM STEWART:::Hi. My name is William Stewart and I am a local Pin Up Artist from Cincinnati, Ohio.

I have been an artist for the past 30 years. I work in a wide range of media including pencil, pastels, and airbrush. Over the past couple years I have been doing a lot of digital mixed media.
The sketches begin as detailed line drawings and they are scanned to the computer. Painting is completed in a wide range of media types. These types include acrylic, airbrush, and pastels. I am best known for my highly detailed photo realistic artwork and I have been very successful using these techniques.

When I completed high school, I wanted to become a commercial artist. Life had other plans for me. After moving in to my first apartment, there was a flood three days before Christmas. I lost my entire portfolio. Zippers are not water proof…. As you can imagine I was devastated. After a week of hair drying the artwork and realizing that black mold is ruthless, I re-evaluate the direction that I needed to go. So I became an IT guy, which is my second love. I landed a great job working for a great company, and I love my job to this day. Seven years ago I had a massive heart attack. I had a 5-way open heart bypass surgery at the age of 40. I had some time to sit around and think about things that I wanted to do with my time, and this was number one on my list. During my time off I decided that I would return to my artwork. I reviewed previous sketches that I had been tossing in a box for the past 15 years, resolving to do something that was very passionate to me. I started doing Pin Up artwork and Mermaids because of my love of the classic Vargas drawings. Other inspiring artwork included people like Olivia and Sorayama. The more I worked on them the happier it made me. My first portfolio was a mixture of different media types and looks, but with one common denominator. The beautiful women were drawn and painted in the most classy and sexy layouts I could envision. Now for the first time I will be offering limited edition prints directly to KickStarter.

My hope is that you will enjoy the classic style of artwork that I do, and that it brings you as much joy as it does me when you look at it. My friends have encouraged me to push forward with my endeavor. I really hope you will enjoy it and help me with your support.:::2338:::440:::0.10166480654761906:::0.3651339285714286:::5:::0:::2015|||"

For the past year, we have been song writing and arranging. We have collaborated with some top musicians from Los Angeles, to create an authentic sound. Our mission is to stay true to the genre, while making our own arrangements and branching out in ways that make sense to a particular song or story. Jesus our requintista, has taken on the task of producing, recording, and engineering in his home studio. We are excited with the work thus far and are ready to go into post production. This is where we are asking for your support. YOUR SUPPORT AND CONTRIBUTIONS

My classical dance career started with the Dutch National Ballet in Amsterdam where I danced roles in works by Georges Balanchine, Martha Graham, Twyla Tharp and Rudi van Dantzig. I returned to Canada a few years later to briefly dance with Alberta Ballet before finally separating from classical ballet to dance as a soloist for La La La Human Steps in Montreal. At La La La, I participated in both on stage and on screen production of Amelia, Les Boreades and Amjad.
In between La La La Human Steps productions, I studied acting in New York City and danced with Hubbard Street Dance Chicago in works by Ohad Naharin, William Forsythe, Nacho Duato and Lar Lubovitch. I returned to Montreal to dance with LaLaLa and then, after the birth of my son in 2009, I completed at degree in Urban Planning at Concordia University. Currently, I am working in Montreal as a freelance dancer on creative collaborations and independent film projects. I've had the chance to work on music videos, visuals and live performance for artists like Justin Timberlake, Karneef, Islands, Alice Glass and Patrick Watson. On the other hand, I am also developing urban projects that bring the city and arts together. It's an exciting, fertile time.

"2069621300:::500717423:::Joseph Perez:::Born and raised in West phoenix, born 1986. Having my first experience with art as a child, being involved with a school mural project opened my mind to a whole new way of thinking about life. Throughout my childhood growing up never loosing the desire to create art, at times I just never had the opportunities before me. For me art became a voice and self identity. As an artist I strive to communicate to society, my community, and people with different backgrounds. I communicate through my visual art, performance, and conceptual art. Art is about creating the conversations visually and mentally with the subject matter I present. Art cannot deny the environment that it is in, so I continue to paint who I am, what I see and what my thoughts reside in. I continue to stay a student of life, push myself to be innovative and relevant with my art so it can have meaning to those that experience it. Everything to me is art, however you view life, can be seen as art, so I have no preference to which medium is used. Having my first small showing downtown Phoenix in 2007, since then I have progressed to doing solo shows at established galleries and museums. In 2010, I developed my “Sound in Color” art, where I showcased the art of B-Boying (Break Dancing), I orchestrated for a live DJ to play music while the dancers responded to beats. This concept was discovered by Independent Curators International to be showcased in a traveling exhibit “The Peoples Biennial”. The show traveled from Portland, Arizona, North Carolina, South Dakota and Pennsylvania. Being able to highlight my dance with my art expression was a great achievement for me. In 2011 I was recognized for my attributes to Phoenix by the Phoenix New Times magazine’s Big Brain Awards which are given out once a year to individuals adding to their city. As a child I was influenced by the art, so for me to give back was always a dream. In 2011 with the collaboration of Arizona State University and Phoenix Center for the Arts we developed “The Rise Project”, which was a vision I had developed and implanted with the two organizations. For me art is a voice to speak to the people and hopefully I can utilize the voice to inspire and motivate.:::2219:::403:::0.08118022328548645:::0.2161350345560872:::1:::2:::2012|||"

While living there he went to Roosevelt; a Milwaukee charter school that specializes in the arts. In his teens he moved to the Fox Cities where he worked several mid-level management jobs throughout his much of his twenties. When he was 28 he quit his job to pursue his life's dream of being a professional artist. Since then Watkins has spent his time painting, drawing, writing lyrics for a rock band, designing games andother game products, and performing his ""action art"" at schools. Cosmo has gained attention for his radical style of spray paint painting from the media. He can often be found on State Street painting for large crowds of passer-bys on most summer Saturdays. He says that the people inspire him to paint and that it is their energy that drives him. In 2007 Andy Watkins founded Cosmo-Joe Entertainment; a company dedicated to the promotion of artists and arts. In 2014 he opened Studio 6d6, a workshop and gallery for creative projects. Most of Studio 6d6's 2000 square feet are dedicated to creating designer game tables. Studio 6d6 has also produced several unique dice designs and is working on several tabletop games.

In 2016 Studio 6d6 moved to a 8,700 sq ft building in Menasha WI where we continue to make great game tables and custom game products. Our new location has allowed us to work on our biggest project ever: RPEX a full scale dungeon RPG for conventions.

"817424348:::1801585456:::brent dewstow-newitt:::The label was established in 2018 as a means to release the back catalogue of renowned Jungle Techno label Underdog Recordings, which ran from 1993-1995. It quickly expanded from beyond the original goal and now reissues sought after, rare and classic records from the Jungle, Rave, Bleep House, Techno and Jungle Techno genres.

The Vinyl Fanatiks aim is to track down and work with the original artists from the early 1990’s, to reissue their music on vinyl only, and to support the record hunters and vinyl diggers from around the world with quality pressings and superb mastering; a way to show respect and share the story of those that created these incredible records.

The vision is not to focus on the obvious artists of that time but to dig a little deeper and find those that came and went but their legacy still holds true to this day. Some of these producers only released one record and vanished soon after but their music still resonates into the 21st century, accumulating new audiences across the globe, far beyond the catchment of the UK pirate radios and muddy fields of 25 years ago. What happened to these artists? Its Vinyl Fanatik’s mission to find out!

Each record captures a moment in time, a vibe that was true and innocent from a period when music was far more synonymous with rebellion and anarchy than today’s finely polished productions and conformist club pop. This music itself bred on the outskirts of society, fuelled by the passion of the rave, its lineage stemming from the Acid House era of 1988. Often produced on minimal equipment, with minimal skills and knowledge, its audio blueprint transcends to new generations, a rawness that no expensive audio plug in could ever create in this present day.

Vinyl Fanatiks wants to pay homage to these young producers who forged the foundations of the multi-million pound EDM scene we have now. Each of these artists has their own tale to tell, their own memories to share. Limited by their own geographical status within the UK, they somehow still all managed to connect and influence each other, years before the internet, mobile phones and social media that we have today. But the music knew no limits and had no boundaries, transcending generations to this day.

"1569700626:::1031782682:::WAO:::Fashion runs after seasons. Fast fashion produces millions of garments every year, leaving its huge mark on society and the environment. It was by observing all this that Michele and Erika decided to do something concrete. It was March 2017. Both coming from the fashion industry, having seen the working conditions and the impact on the environment of the fashion factories in places like China and Turkey, they decided to develop a new approach, distancing themselves from the usual fashion business model. For their products they wanted a clear supply chain, working together with ethical companies and, above all, they wanted to take care of the disposal.
The desire to shout their revolution gave birth to WAO! This is how it all started. After one year of research for the right materials and companies, the first prototype was born.
Little by little, sharing the project among friends and professional networks, they involved more and more people who are sensitive to the climate change issue. Operational roles grew, as well as the skills and the support to the project. One year ago, for our debut on Kickstarter, among founding partners and contractors, we were about twenty people. Fashion is the second largest polluter in the world after oil. One year ago, end of October 2018, thanks to the different professional skills of the people involved, we were ready to present shoes made outside the usual fashion system, inspired by the principles of ethics, sustainability and solidarity which are part of our Code of Ethics. And which are made and sold with the least environmental impact possible. Today, 10th November 2019, we’re continuing to develop and offer products using the same ethical system. A truly eco-friendly production is possible and, thanks to your support, we can keep making it! WAO, the eco effect shoes.:::1838:::304:::0.056069624819624825:::0.25573693282026616:::2:::0:::2018|||"

"144001931:::1635627103:::Vrailler, Inc.:::On September 2016, I was alone at the border region of France and Spain about to start my 730km pilgrimage on the route known as The Camino de Santiago with a backpack stuffed things that weighed over 10kg. It was a challenging journey that takes people about a month to cover on foot from one end of Spain to the other. I knew I had hard a task in front of me. I did not know if I was ready to take on the challenge. I was inspired both by fear and excitement at the same time. I have cerebral palsy. I always try to put on a smile each and every day, but the truth of the matter is, I am not doing that because I feel happy. I do it instead to look normal. I told myself that I not different from those around me. All my forty years of life, I wanted to prove to the others that I am no different than them. That’s why I lived a very stiff life up to this day.

But I realize now that no one is really normal. Each and every one of us can only live life in his or her unique and dramatic way. Who among us can really make the claim that they are leading a normal lives after all? Who’s even qualified to make that judgement? No one is.

The 25km journey I made each day allowed me to encounter many people from all over the world. I had pleasant talk with many of them, but some gave me no so pleasant stares. But I know now that even those stares are not stares of fear but the stares of encouragements. It really gave me a chance to recalibrate the looks I received over the forty years of my life.

When I made it to Santiago de Compostela, and completed my journey after about 35 days, I was exhausted soaked in sweat, but the congratulatory cheers from friends I made along the way made it all the more worth it. It was the most exhilarating moment in my life.

I am introducing a new product in this campaign. It is a product that embodies the spirit of communication. It represents our willingness to encourage openness among those who share dreams and interests. What is communication, after all, if not the process though which we open ourselves to new possibilities by sharing our interests and working towards the common goal? I can’t never forget the warm, friendly look from a Spanish friend who shared his water with me along the mountain range of Pyrenees, a memory of an old charming lady who was kind enough to keep me company while I was taking a break from a long walk, or my friend Becky who offered a band aid to help me nurse my scared feet.

I knew then that it wasn’t cheap pity but genuine concerns for the others that made them carry out those acts of kindness. And responded in kind with genuine appreciation for what they had done for me, without any reservations or forethoughts. I realize now that it is this kind of genuine communication we seek and deserve from one onther. We all crave genuine communication, and I wish you all this kind of genuine communication that inspire kindness and respect towards each other this season.:::2973:::572:::0.1572640285341898:::0.428578119908765:::1:::2:::2018|||"

"1366968235:::1793683365:::Gustaf Fjelstrom:::Gustaf Fjelstrom is a San Francisco Bay Area bassist, composer and producer. As an independent artist focused on instrumental works, Gustaf composes, records and performs ambient, looping, electronic post-rock. As a founding member of the power-trio Maximum Indifference in the late ’90’s, Gustaf composed and performed a unique body of cinematic instrumental rock music. By 2009, Gustaf had completed his inaugural solo release, METAMESMERIC, which featured his live-looping approach on the bass cello.

In 2015, Gustaf released INTENTION, a collection of ambient, down tempo, post-rock pieces. The music composed for INTENTION represents a full-spectrum approach, incorporating ambient textures, nostalgic washes of analog synth, layers of live drums and programmed rhythms, etherial vocals, and rich, luxurious bass guitar. To support the release of this album, one that is sure to establish Gustaf’s voice in the genre. INTENTION is an exploration of complex soundscapes composed to evoke a mature and layered musical narrative evocative of the many layered emotional and rational components that create intent and purpose in each of our lives. In 2016 Gustaf began writing and recording the follow-up to INTENTION. BY the fall he had amassed enough material for more that two albums. As the material organized itself into two groupings, there were a few tracks that didn’t quite fit with either grouping, so he released those on the EP DIAMETRIC in the fall of 2016. Gustaf quick turned his focus back to finishing off the first grouping and in March of 2016 it was completed. THE PERIPHERAL ARC: VOLUME I is the first in what will eventually be a three-album cycle. It continues on the trajectory of some of the higher energy moments of INTENTION, while delving deeper into the realms of ambient bass guitar, analog synths, and lush, etherial textures (and of course, massive regular bass!). THE PERIPHERAL ARC: VOLUME I is due out in August of 2017 on Vinyl, Compact Disc, and Digital.The album is the latest in Gustaf’s journey of musical composition that blends sound and emotion to create fundamental audio narratives.:::2130:::346:::0.08233754208754208:::0.37864173789173794:::2:::22:::2010|||"

It all started a few years ago with a group of art students in Scotland working on a class project together. I wanted to make a game where we could feature hilarious items and monsters so we designed a cooperative dungeon-crawler card game which eventually became “Beasts, Bards, and a Bottle of Whoop-Ass.” Back in Boston, the following year was almost entirely spent designing “Landfall” in order to quench our thirst to make something deeply entrenched in the sci-fi genre. Simultaneous to all these, tons of ideas bubbled up and bounced around along the way, and bit by bit “Crumbs” was designed, and quickly became my most finished game yet.

K.C. Finn:

K.C. Finn has been writing since 2011, at a time when extreme illness saw her trapped in the house with nothing but her imagination. Since then she's amassed a collection of stories, poems and novels spanning many genres, including fantasy, science fiction, gothic fiction, horror, paranormal and historical works. Her unique and diverse voice has won many awards, and she is both an Amazon and USA Today best-selling writer.


Kell Cowley:

Chester author Kell Cowley wrote and illustrated her first novel at age eight, telling the story of a runaway radish escaping from a salad bowl to explore the far reaches of the vegetable garden. She has been perplexing her friends and family with her weird stories ever since. She holds a BA in Performance Writing from the wildly experimental Dartington College of Arts, won a novelist’s apprenticeship with the Adventures in Fiction development scheme and was a prize winning finalist in the international cli-fi competition for the ‘Everything Change’ anthology. When she occasionally closes her laptop or latest reading obsession to spend time in the real world, she will likely be found shambolically running a school library, attempting to act in local plays or eco-warrioring her way towards the apocalypse.:::1360:::223:::0.033939393939393936:::0.3877272727272727:::1:::0:::2018|||"

I started practicing magic in 2006 but I started doing it professionally in 2010 and in these years I start to have the first appreciation from the Italian magic environment. In 2015 I did my first magic production called INSOMNIA produced by Titanas Magicand distributed by Murphy's Magic.
In 2016 I had the honor of working for Lost Art Magic,a big magic production company, with Xavior Spade and Eric Jones.
I continue to spend all of my time doing magic for work and passion.
In 2018 I launched my first deck of cards on kickstarter, Medusa playing cards with 7 marking systems, which achieved the goal with great success over 11k Euro, and that's how my playing cards company was born, which takes the name from this first deck and that wants to be leader in the production of marked decks.:::988:::178:::0.31833333333333336:::0.556031746031746:::1:::0:::2018|||"

"919049107:::1583872215:::Munchkin Metropolis:::Hi there, I'm Roger Kolikas. I'm the owner of a small construction/woodworking company called Munchkin Metropolis, where I specialize in custom items for kids mostly, but I've gradually been growing in the gaming accessory industry. Fancy custom deck boxes are pretty neat and add a bit of flare to anyone's deck!

I never did care for talking about myself much, but since this is the only way you can get to know me for now, that's about it for the business side of me. I've linked all my pages so you can get a better feel for who I am as a person and the quality of work you can expect from me should you choose to back one of my projects.

On to the personal side of me. (I don't have one, I'm a mystery....if mysteries weren't mysterious)

I was born and raised down south in Mississippi. My earliest memories are of playing outside with a stick (Sword) and fighting a terrible beast (Pet hamster). We had recently moved to a piece of property that only had a well for water. No house, barn, building of any kind, we lived in a tent that first summer. We were to build our house during our first summer there. And we did! (Sort of...I mean, it was a single room with plywood floor and 3 walls, the 4th wall was just plastic stapled to the studs. But on that wall is where we had our wood burning stove/heater. (I've never been as warm in a house since, and we had 3ft of snow that first winter!) We had a 5 gallon bucket and a sheet hung up as a bathroom. But it worked, and I loved it! We had a 55 gallon drum mounted with a draining hose that had a shower head attached, so we could shower on warm days...cold days too, but I don't count that as a shower. It was more like scrub scrub scrub, fast fast fast, let me out!

As you can tell, I had an AMAZING CHILDHOOD! It was like camping all the time. Booyah!

I go my first job at the age of 8, as a gopher (Go for this, Go for that) on the construction site my grandma's husband worked at. It paid $2/day....and that was a lot for me back then. I could go to the $1 theater on Saturday, play arcades, get the LARGE popcorn/drink combo and watch movies all day long with my own money. (That's right, MY money)

I learned at a young age how to live broke, and I'm glad I did. That knowledge comes in handy whenever life tries to knock me down. I grew up proper and joined the Marines at 17. Stayed there a few years before coming home and starting my own company (Woodworking, right?....wrong!) Selling at a flea market. It was good money sometimes, bad money sometimes, but I was the boss (Of myself only, but still, it counts....right?) I worked the market and craft shows for a couple years before stumbling into a mom & pop Video store (Old school, still did VHS and only had like 7 DVDs at the time). I bought out the bin of VHS they had for sale (At a discount so I could resell them) and I left them my number in case they had more to sell later on. Business must have been bad, because not even a month later they called and asked me to offer a price on all the movies they had left. I did them one better and offered to buy the store as it sat. That store's name was Reel World. Little did I know that one decision would change my life forever. I took that store and turned it into the first DVD only store around (This was back in 1996).... It did well until not 1, but 2 large movie rental chains came to town. But, you know the drill (Improvise, Adapt, Overcome)....So, I made a switch and started carrying more games. More and more kids started hanging out at the store and eventually one of them requested I start carrying Magic the Gathering (In my mind, wth is that?) Fast forward a year and we are the only shop around running FNM and JSS events. I cut the DVD rentals down to a single shelf, the rest of the space was for couches, TVs and original Xbox systems (We had 16 and they stayed full with kids play 16 player Halo over the LAN). It was a great time to game!

{But wait, you said you've been woodworking your whole life, how'd you do that while you were doing all this other stuff?}

The answer? I never stopped, it just wasn't a business, it was a hobby I did for fun. I also picked up leathercrafting along the way, just fyi. Munchkin Metropolis is a company I originally started as a home improvement company that specialized in Children's playsets, playhouses, furniture (We did grown up things too)

Eventually I married and got talked into selling the shop.... 6 months later they had ran it into the ground and all the local kids had nowhere to go. Of course I had to reopen! They must have a place to go! Throughout the years I've had 7 renditions of Reel World Games (We added the ""Games"", but kept the name of the original shop). And just 3 years ago, I moved right back into the same building where I purchased Reel World 20 years ago. Life is funny sometimes. Now I get to do both, Reel World & Woodworking, in the same building (Different bays).

I don't make a killing, but I'm pretty happy most of the time (Except on Sunday, that's when we count the register)

Now you know my story, why not message me yours? I love listening to how other people have lived.:::5177:::1015:::0.1509833084394488:::0.4003405504501995:::22:::13:::2014|||"

I don't want to use everyday ""life"" as an excuse not to try and accomplish some of these things that I've been put off. Next thing you know you're old and haven't tried a dang thing. So I decided to bite the bullet and start these indie comic projects. With any luck I'll hit the goals.:::601:::127:::0.03571428571428572:::0.22261904761904763:::6:::65:::2016|||"

"177108245:::1820018931:::Stuart Semple:::We are a small team of young artists and paint makers based out of an art studio in Dorset, England.

Stuart Semple is behind our creations, he’s a renowned British artist, who has been making paintings and doing art shows around the world for about 15 years. A bit like painters used to do in the old days, Stuart made his own materials to use in his work (initially looking for the most vibrant colour palette out there).

Stuart’s materials all had special qualities and he started to call them ‘the artyist art materials’. He made powders like the world’s pinkest pink & glitteriest glitter. With the help of other artists around the globe he made potions like Black 2.0, and his super special - SuperBase.

The big idea is that we want to help artists make work that wasn't possible before.

Rather than hoard these amazing creations to use all for himself, so that he and he alone could wield the power of the colouriest colours, Stuart made culturehustle.com and set up our studio so we can share these potent concoctions of his with all artists (except one - his arch nemesis Kapoor the colour hoarder).

We properly love making paint and making art. We are artists that make cool materials for other artists. We do things by hand and we never cheap-out on ingredients. We use only the finest pigments, binders and polymers that money can buy anywhere. We want you to make great art, so we want to make you great materials.:::1441:::261:::0.17828296703296703:::0.5117078754578754:::1:::0:::2018|||"
"6110834:::506890661:::Chiara Taffarello:::I was born in Treviso, a small city near Venice and I graduated in fashion design in Milan at IED MODA Lab institute. In the last fifteen years I have worked as denim and casualwear designer as well as a buyer for many brands and retailers, and I have spent a lot of time traveling and doing research around the world.
During my studies I cooperated with Yoox, Bulgari and Brooke. My first job was in GEOX as Junior apparel collection designer and product developer. After that experience I worked for few years as head designer in a Consulting studio, where my duties were helping different clients in following the whole life cycle of the collection from the mood research and design to the development of final samples. Then I started my experience as Head of Denim and Teenager department in BENETTON. During these years I witnessed the big boom of the fast fashion retailers and the buyer profile was becoming crucial, so I decided to improve my skills moving into the buying world.
At the beginning I worked for MIROGLIO group, then I moved to INDITEX in Spain, where I was in charge of BERSHKA, managing denim as responsible of the Basic Denim collection, designing and fchecking the product development.

In 2014 I moved back to Italy where I had the opportunity to put into practice all my skills working as APPAREL and ACCESSORIES CATEGORY MANAGER for AW-LAB retail at BATA group. In that position I had the chance to cooperate with brands like Adidas, Nike, Vans, Puma and many others.

Two years ago I moved to Ancona where my partner lives. In that very period I decided to embark on my own business and I opened ELEVEN CHIC consulting studio. I offer design consultancy, developing capsule collections for manufacturing companies, and I cooperate with brands like Zara, HM, Guess, Twin-Set, Mango, etc…

Last year I worked for a manufacturing company in Pakistan. It was a very inspiring experience for me and this is when I started to develop MUNAMER concept.

The idea was born from my inquisitive habit of observing different cultures during my trips: I found that some common traditional clothes like kurtas or saree are so colorful, fancy and decorated, but there is nothing similar on beachwear… There are so many styles and interesting prints on bikinis but there is nothing similar when we look at Burkinis.

When I realised this, I started my research about MODESTWEAR buying samples, trying them on myself, looking for new ideas in local markets and thinking about new designs so as to find the best way to mix the western trends with the traditional taste. My designs actually are an evolution of the fits which are currently in the market, mixed with western shapes and details. My mission is to celebrate all women, giving them the opportunity to be elegant, comfortable and modest. Modest Fashion is going to be soon a global trend as many other ways to dress and FOR ME IS AN HONOR and a CHALLENGE to be THE FIRST ITALIAN DESIGNER to create a MODEST BRAND. I want to prove with my BURKINI that modestwear is not boring and unstylish and I hope to be able to mix the italian taste with the modest market needs the best way possible . MUNAMER is the dream of a designer, traveller and life lover, with a big eye into the world, for happy women and multicultural support!:::3309:::577:::0.17900690579262007:::0.38689282278567994:::1:::1:::2018|||"

I blend candid lifestyle shots with a perspective of landscape, without interfering the intimate moments. Keeping the posed shots to a minimum, I capture all the genuine good vibes and raw emotions that make your story uniquely yours.

Most couples who contact me have no idea in terms of destination and that’s ok. Because I love sharing my knowledge on where and when is the best to travel. On any given day, you will find me on Google maps searching endlessly for my next adventure or scrolling through Airbnb till the very last listing while setting multiple price alerts on Google flights. You can think of me as full-fledged travel butler or super involved photographer.

Exploring new places and going off the beaten track are what make me tick. I’m guessing you kind of feel the same, and that’s why you are here.

So if you are ready for an adventure, and just so happen to be a couple crazily in love, let’s talk and create something special!

Un crayon ou un pinceau à la main, je me sens bien et si je m’installe dans mon petit atelier derrière ma table à dessin, je peux y rester des heures concentrée sur ma réalisation. J’ai beaucoup de difficultés à abandonner même pour quelques heures le travail commencé et je n’arrive pas à « décrocher », quand je commence un dessin ou une peinture, je dois aller jusqu’au bout tout de suite…
Ma famille et mes amis m’ont toujours encouragée et c’est comme cela que ma petite entreprise est née… J’ai commencé mes créations pour leurs faire-part de mariage, naissance, puis j’ai décliné mes illustrations sur d’autres supports. Ma gamme de papeterie est ainsi née.

Aujourd'hui illustratrice freelance, j'illustre les histoires que ma maman, éducatrice de jeunes enfants depuis plus de trente ans, écrit avec douceur et imagination.:::931:::177:::0.03333333333333333:::0.06666666666666667:::1:::0:::2018|||"

"302306827:::518201285:::Charlotte de la Porte:::Aussi loin que je me souvienne, j’ai toujours voulu dessiner, créer ...

J’ai évolué dans une famille qui m’a appris à avoir ma propre personnalité sans suivre, tête baissée, les modes des saisons. J’ai donc développé très tôt mon propre style. Cette indépendance et cette envie d’être différente ont fait germer l’envie de créer ma propre marque. Une marque qui propose autrement, différemment ses collections. Nous sommes toutes uniques et le port d’un détail, comme un sac audacieux qui sublime une tenue, amplifiera cette originalité.

Pour dessiner mes collections, rien de plus simple (si l’on veut…), je m’inspire de ce que j’aime : l’art, mes souvenirs, les couleurs, les paysages,… Bref, tout ce qui me parle et me donne envie de dessiner jusque plus soif.

La Gräfin, c’est un pan de mon histoire qui se résume à quelques personnes importantes à mes yeux. Mon grand père qui, depuis toujours, m’a fortement impressionnée par son élégance et son indépendance d’esprit. Mais aussi cette héroïne de roman que nous aimions évoquer entre amis, La Gräfin, femme forte, indépendante, respectant les conventions pour mieux les briser. Le surnom m’est resté.

En parallèle de mes études de stylisme et de mes expériences, je mûrissais ce projet pour qu'il se concrétise. Aujourd'hui il passe du rêve à la réalité.:::1322:::243:::0.041666666666666664:::0.1130952380952381:::1:::0:::2018|||"

"750435745:::640556106:::Alejandra:::Cuando tenía 21 años aún no sabía cuál era mi sexualidad, qué me gustaba o me dejaba de gustar. La opinión de los demás siempre me dio igual, tan solo quería saber aquello que yo quería.

Hasta que llegó ella, me pidió que escribiese, le dije que sí y desde entonces no dejé de escribir y tampoco de decirles que “sí”.

Entonces no sé que es lo que vino primero, si fueron “ellas” o si fue “escribir” o quizás fue al revés.

Siete años después he conseguido escribir cinco historias distintas en el tiempo, pero sobretodo, en madurez. La primera está llena de miedos e inseguridades de una niña que no sabía muy bien qué hacía (“La realidad entró sin llamar”). Mi segundo libro fue una huida de la realidad (corazón o cabeza). El tercero será un libro que no tendrá fin o quizás sí, pregúnteselo a ella (“Princesas que visten de azul”). El siguiente nació en Londres, volví a estar perdida, no había un “ella”, así que no me quedó más remedio que inventarla y así llegó “Seven Sister”. Luego sufrí un “parto” de esos que se quedan en un aborto natural y nació “La habitación de al lado”

PD: Si quieres saber más sobre mí, qué hay detrás de una persona que escribe cuando nadie la ve, siempre puedes seguirme en Linkedin (Alejandra Carretero García). Allí podrás encontrar qué es lo que hago cuando todos me ven o qué es lo que solía hacer.

I worked mostly on the development of OEM metal accessories for ready-to-wear, handbags and footwear. Based on a simple sketch, or simply an idea, I had to be able to give reality to the expectations of the client. But i also help some customers to source Watch for Jewellery factories and developed for them new collection for Men & Women.

My technical approach as well functional and design one allowed me to make possible the wishes of the client even if sometimes some requests were impossible in logic.

My functions were not limited to realizing the project; I sometimes applied my vision to it or created the whole concept. This happens especially for elements or concepts of jewelry, button, handbag lock or even a shell concept for IPhone.

I regularly create concepts according to what inspires me in everyday life: jewelry / jacket for motorcycle / drink accessories for bars helmet bag....

Drawing is a way to absorb the beauty of the world around me, but also, a way to understand my surroundings, how an object is put together, why a building or configuration of light and shadow caught her eye.

"1710808927:::2065892436:::Hoa:::Jewelery is my passion – a sort of its own form of art

Jewelry has always been my greatest passion. Designing my own jewelry and with this inspiring other people, is my dream since I discovered silver jewelry for me when I was a teenager. Brands that had a huge influence on me were thus like Buddha to Buddha, King Baby, Chrome Hearts, Scott Kay, Elfcraft, Vallenstein. The attention to details is something I ought particularly to care about, which is why every single ring is hand-crafted and then carefully considered. Only when I am completely satisfied with the workmanship, the details and the fitting, it will be released for sale. In order to achieve the desired perfection of my work, I work with two very talented friends. Moreover, we produce 100% in Germany, which is a significant unique selling point in today's globalized market situation. Since our jewelry is processed by hand, minor deviations between the rings may occur. However, we always strive for the highest quality. Each ring has its own character, so does the wearer himself. This is the fascinating thing about silver - it adapts to its wearer.:::1126:::192:::0.39924963924963924:::0.7298520923520923:::1:::0:::2018|||"

"1611270022:::807381618:::Mary Bue:::“If intimacy intrigues you and makes you into a skittish peeping tom, then be sure to catch Bue at her next performance.” – Alan Sparhawk, Low

Mary Bue is an indie musician and yoga studio owner based in Minneapolis. A prolific songwriter with 7 albums under her belt, Mary’s music touches upon archetypal themes of the human condition: love, loss, triumph, dreams, and the natural world. A longtime student of yoga and psychology since her early teens, Mary weaves sacred subject matter into her songs with inquiries into the spirit, the seeking of deeper levels of consciousness, and deep concern for the environment all mixed into her sometimes crass, real-world hue. Mary recently opened Imbue Yoga in South Minneapolis – an intimate, beginner friendly studio featuring many lineages of yoga – quite the “multi-passionate entrepreneur.” For the early half of 2017 Mary was an Artist in Residence at the Wurlitzer Foundation in Taos, NM – spending time creating in solitude, along the Rio Grande river gorge and Sangre de Cristo mountains. She released her 7th project The Majesty of Beasts in May 2017 which landed on 2017’s Best of Minnesota Music lists for the Minneapolis Star Tribune and #3 in the City Pages. Mary’s long-time support of PAVSA (Program for Aid to Victims of Sexual Assault) as well as the release of this EP was also recognized in November, honoring Mary with 2017 Community Ally of the Year.

NEW EP THE MAJESTY OF BEASTS

The Majesty of Beasts is Mary Bue’s 7th release, thick with transformative events which occurred in its making. The content ranges from trivial, catchy pop-punk to harrowing personal hell. From leaving behind a broken dishwasher and a toaster oven in “The Shit I left in Duluth,” to feeling like an aging loser in a sea of hipsters at a bar in “Minnesota Goodbye,” Mary ventures deeper into environmental and humanitarian concerns in the title track “The Majesty of Beasts.” By far her most aggressive recording to date is “Petty Misdemeanor” in which Bue reveals to the public for the first time her experience of being a victim/survivor of sexual assault and the injustice/betrayal/failure of the legal system and close communities when dealing with this type of trauma (a portion of the proceeds of records sold will go to aid for supporting victims of sexual assault).

The Majesty of Beasts is Mary Bue’s first venture onto vinyl with a limited edition run of EPs. This album fit together like puzzle of numerous moving parts: a prize from Welcome to 1979 studios in Nashville’s Battle of the Bands, (where the EP was recorded), a career development grant from the Arrowhead Regional Arts Council, a successful crowdfunding venture with Kickstarter and a coming together and breaking up of a band of two years (not to mention a divorce and a move to Minneapolis). These four songs are a close companion in nature to 2015’s Holy Bones and is a sentiment to the depths Mary continues to plumb in her own personal heavens and hells as well as our society’s.

Full Bio:

“There is a curious power in the ability to view one’s life with an unjaundiced eye. It’s not about being fearless, although that doesn’t hurt, it’s about the ferocity of spirit required to accept the world as it is and move forward from there. Singer/songwriter Mary Bue’s songs crackle with this power, mixing piano and guitar, folk and pop, and redolent with private tragedy and shared elation. Her voice, described as “marvelously sultry and cool,” lends her vivid, sometimes existential lyrics a texture that is both intimate and expansive. This intimacy is Mary’s calling card. Her lyrics invite you in and you’re right there with her as she sings, barefoot in the sand or walking along the Mississippi, heart pounding from your chest, letting go, hanging on, vibrant, alive. She brings you into her adventures, trials, and triumphs through her lyrics, and keeps you engaged with melodies you’ll find yourself humming to yourself long after the music has ended.” – Aaron Richner

Mary describes her ownMary Bue work as the retellings of adventures, mishaps, and pains-in-the-ass. Which is simply to say that through her experiences touring the country, studying yoga from 2008 to 2011 in Seattle, attaining a Bachelors degree in psychology and falling in and out of love, she has a lot of wisdom to retell. The songs are a map she has drawn through the depths of the ocean of human experience; and even though the lyrics are often pulled from secret, dark places, Marys presence is a positive one, full of laughter and light. – Amy Clark, KAXE

An accomplished recording artist and touring musician, Mary’s 6 studio albums manage to capture her electrifying stage presence. Mary’s last two albums were 100% fan-funded via Kickstarter. She has been awarded the “Escape to Create” Artist in Residence in Seaside, FL, and the Big Cypress Nature Preserve Artist in Residence in Ochopee, FL. Over many years, 44 states, hundreds of thousands of miles and countless venues from tiny coffee shops to large outdoor festivals, Mary has shared the stage with many talented musicians, including Erin McKeown, Johnette Napolitano (Concrete Blonde), Emm Gryner, Kathleen Edwards, Alan Sparhawk from Low, Marissa Nadler, Rose Polenzani, Jess Klein, Sarah Borges, Mason Jennings, Haley Bonar, Jack Johnson, Vetiver, Cory Chisel, Nicole Atkins, Jeremy Messersmith, Anaïs Mitchell, Audra Kubat, Vandaveer, Chris Bathgate and too many more to list here.

CURRENT TIMES:

In 2014, Mary was awarded a career development grant from Arrowhead Regional Arts Council (ARAC) with the proposal to stretch & challenge her skills and release an album on her second instrument, the guitar (piano being her first instrument). The result was 2015’s “Holy Bones” deemed “Highly recommended” by the Minneapolis Star Tribune. Also in 2014, Mary won a full day of recording at Nashville’s Welcome to 1979 Studio. In 2016 she cashed in on that prize and recorded “Majesty of Beasts” a four song EP to be released on vinyl in January 2017. Amidst all of the music stuff, a few years of touring + gigging full time, Mary moved to Minneapolis in May 2016 to open a yoga studio – Imbue Yoga. She currently runs & teaches at the studio with 5 other instructors, and is gearing up for a 3 month Artist in Residence award in Taos, NM January – April 2017 at the Helene Wurlitzer Foundation. Never a dull moment …

About Mary’s last Album Holy Bones:

Holy Bones is an indie-pop, musical commentary regarding a frazzled & hungry society. Written primarily on electric guitar with thick bass & rock ‘n roll drums, her new sound is fresher and lighter even when exploring the shadows of the modern American psyche. Mary Bue’s 6th studio album is a creative shift from her typical piano-driven singer-songwriting, funded in part by a career development grant from the Arrowhead Regional Arts Council of Minnesota.

The impetus for Holy Bones sprang out nightmares of cleaving a grand piano in half with a table saw. Sassy and full of fire and joy, the songs explore themes like simplicity, following your bliss, mindfulness and love as well as darker shades of human experience – addiction, family dysfunction, mortality and the inhumane treatement of animals. Pop-punk track Cheribum sings of a child angel digging around in the dump for love letters, Veal is sung from the perspective of a calf confined and going to slaughter, to “certainly never jump over the moon.” Archaeology is a wistful, country-esque love song about the history told by examining a troubled couple’s recycling bin.

Holy Bones is a reflection of the shattered attention spans which swirl in modern American life, the enormous pressure we carry to attain wealth and success, and the ultimate bliss of letting go.:::7883:::1371:::0.16180129669713:::0.4182038640371973:::4:::55:::2011|||"

The Rehabilitation Centre provides the facilities for longer term rehabilitation (confined housing, flight pens, and pools) to take our patients through the recovery process until release. The hospital and rehabilitation centre are open 7 days a week, 365 days a year.

I have been fascinated with natural history as long as I can remember. I started building dinosaur skeletons for museum gallery exhibits when I was 19. I took over my employer's company when I was 26. I have since contracted out my big dinosaurs and have been tinkering with developing new products to bring the dinosaurs to market for the average person, not just the big museums.

"45445541:::1513492796:::Courtney Askey:::Courtney Askey is a Leicester based artist, musician, writer and curator working in installation, video, digital and sound.
Her work stems from a fascination with the ever-changing world of technology and digital spaces that are now a constant in our lives. Ranging through from the nostalgic tech from her childhood in the early noughties, to the present day in which devices are constantly updated with new exciting possibilities, she explores the developing aesthetic of the internet and online culture. Her work confronts our habitation of digital spaces and engages with debates around identity and the self in relation to online presence. The visual aspects of her video work is deeply intertwined with its accompanying sound due to the artist's background as a musician; her work has previously explored synaesthesia and crossovers of the senses.:::854:::135:::0.04554545454545454:::0.22326262626262627:::1:::0:::2018|||"

I was born and raised in Iowa but moved to Georgia just as I was finishing High School. After graduating I worked odd jobs in the restaurant industry and some construction work. A few weeks following 911 I enlisted in the United States Army. I knew our Nation was going to war, and as a young, physically fit man I wasn't comfortable with others sacrificing while i reaped the benefits. Shortly following basic training and AIT, I met the love of my life. Not to get too sappy here, but the very first words i ever spoke to my wife were ""yes, I will marry you"". We married 4 months after we met. We moved to Colorado Springs while i was stationed at Fort Carson in April of 2003. In May my son was born. 3 Days later I left for Iraq. Despite the challenges I faced during my deployment, to include my injury, I feel they were nothing compared to those of my wife who was in an unfamiliar state, halfway around the world from her family (Half British, Half Thai), with a baby by herself, at such a young age (18). I came home from Iraq in Feb 04 and worked through physical therapy for over a year before the Army decided on a medical separation. Over the next several years our marriage had its ups and downs, I worked in several different fields. We continued to expand our family and both went to school. While difficult, we both prevailed. Her with a bachelors in Ministry and me with a bachelors in political science. Along the way I somewhat fell into working as a corrections officer, which I had done for nearly a decade years. I am now employed as a probation officer and finished the police academy in june 2019.:::1785:::335:::0.025701754385964917:::0.24604010025062656:::16:::3:::2017|||"

"544717203:::693286373:::Alessandra Levato:::I grew up in Lancaster, PA and am currently living in NYC while attending Art College. It was not until I began painting as an early teenager, that I realized it was my passion. Since that time I have had countless opportunities in various mediums and techniques which have allowed my skills to develop and enhanced my passion by expressing myself through art.
I’ve continued my exposure in art, by visiting museums, traveling on a few trips abroad, and going to gallery openings. I have been immersed in art during all of my high school and college years. I am extremely influenced by impressionistic painters, sculptors, and love drawing, and various works of architecture. I am further influenced by the environment around me.
In terms of artists, I have been most affected by Vincent Van Gogh, Leonardo Da Vinci, John Singer Sargent and Claude Monet. My favorite author is Ernest Hemingway. I find his writing inspirational, which paints pictures in my mind.
My hope as an artist is that through expressive brush strokes, that convey both light and contrasting views, I will be able to convey my peaceful, quiet inner self in a somewhat noisy chaotic world. I would like my point of view to be seen and perhaps influence the viewer. I feel that I am always surrounded by energy from the universe, which keeps me grounded with limitless amounts of inspiration to help me find and grasp my own identity.:::1408:::244:::0.20076923076923078:::0.5457051282051282:::4:::0:::2016|||"

Bio
Paul was born in St.Thomas, Ontario, Canada on January 14th, 1977. When Paul was eight he moved to London, Ontario with his family and started studying piano. By the age of ten, Paul had auditioned for St. Mary’s Choir and Orchestra Program in London. This blessing opened many doors to expand and grow Paul's artistic talents in music and the performing arts through this incredible music program gaining a solid music education expanding love through music.

Paul’s passion for music and art continued to bloom in High School where he attended Catholic Central High School in London, Ontario - a specialized extension program developed to continue music studies from St. Mary’s Choir and Orchestra Program. Paul was included in an adventure to sing for the late Pope John Paul II as part of the CCH Choir in a private audience at the Vatican in Vatican City. As a teen, Paul performed with Choirs for The Blue Jays, The Boston Red Sox and The Detroit Tigers at stadiums filled with 10's of 1000's of adoring baseball fans. Paul has always supported Music and Art. He believes in keeping Art Programs alive and healthy within the public school systems to provide children the opportunities to grow reflection through the creative process. Paul and his close family sadly lost his 56 year old Father to suicide in March of 2011. This tragic loss has been a huge inspiration of opening hearts and trying to inspire the World through writing music that is reflective and at the same time calming. Paul has always maintained keeping his music as true to form with simplicity without over editing to allow the souls honesty to dance with the listeners heart. Paul writes with the intention of finding peace within oneself in order to truly manifest peace externally in our beautiful World with the ultimate goal of inspiring Global Kindness through all of his music compositions.

Paul has worked very closely and continues to be a guest speaker and volunteer/contributor with the 'Canadian Mental Health Association' (CMHA). Paul has been a featured Singer/Songwriter by Songwriters Association of Canada (S.A.C.) for his work with Suicide Awareness and Social Change Songwriting. His career also includes partnering with international charities to advance social awareness issues advancing equality and human rights for all people of our World. Paul has also been honoured by the Premier of Ontario - The Honourable Kathleen Wynne for his work with Suicide Awareness. Paul released his first body of work on September 1st, 2011 titled ""Blessings From Above"" A.K.A. ""Beautiful World"" consisting of 5 short tracks of Paul's piano and vocal arrangements. On February 29th, 2012 Paul released his 2nd Album Titled ""Worthy"" which was recorded Live on a Grand Piano in Toronto, Ontario Canada with 7 easy-listening songs. ""Diamond Light"" Paul's 3rd Album released Internationally on January 14th, 2014 with a total number of 9 tracks with very elaborate mixes including piano & vocals accompanied by lovely strings, soulful keyboards, drums, and guitars. Paul's 4th Album ""Love Expanding Love"" was funded by Paul's fans from every corner of the planet and released Internationally on November 11th, 2014 with 11 tracks each consisting of an intention to help our world to expand love from the heart of the listener. The themes in these songs touch on social issues such as honouring the elderly, feeding every mouth, being kind to all life, dreaming your biggest dream, putting your hand on your heart and saying I love you to yourself, reminding listeners that grown men do in fact cry which is perfectly healthy and natural, etc. Paul ventured out in front of audiences to inspire and promote love and kindness through reflective concerts. This show was titled 'DIAMOND LIGHT' which included sharing stories of creating loving moments through his music career and how this process has unfolded through becoming the person he has always dreamed he could become with hard work and dedication to love itself. Paul's dream, vision, and ultimate goal in his work is to remind hearts to help one another by focusing on creating peace, love, joy, happiness and prosperity.

On November 25th, 2013 Paul won his first International Songwriting Award for his song 'DIAMOND LIGHT' from the ""2013 USA Songwriting Contest"" an International contest consisting of 10's of 1000's of song submissions from some of the most prolific songwriters from all over the World. This award is called ""The Honourable Mention Award"". 'DIAMOND LIGHT' was also selected as a finalist for the grand prize of being best song of the year for 2013. Paul's Album 'DIAMOND LIGHT' won the 2013 ""Top 10 Award"" in London, by the London Free Press.

Paul believes in spreading Abundant Peace, Love, Joy, Happiness and Prosperity with as much kindness as humanly possible. Deepak Chopra, Oprah, Ellen, and Rosie O'Donnell along with many New Age Authors and Thought Leaders have been the light of Paul's growth through much adversity. These wonderful human hearts have changed the face of our World with their love and perpetual belief in kindness.:::9231:::1493:::0.25115372867430286:::0.4076189744333285:::3:::0:::2014|||"

En del av arbetet för Dawit Isaak är olika kampanjer som påminner både allmänhet och opinionsbildare om hans fall. Uppmärksamhetsarbetet av detta slag har två syften. Dels bidrar det till att Dawits öde fortsätter att vara aktuellt hos alla beslutsfattare. Det blir helt enkelt svårare att glömma bort Dawit när hans fall ständigt diskuteras. Dels är detta något som håller Dawit vid liv. Många som suttit fängslade i längre tider berättar om att information trots allt alltid sipprar igenom. Inte varje dag eller varje gång en manifestation sker. Men regelbundet under ett år är vi övertygade om att Dawit får signaler om att han inte är bortglömd. Vid varje tillfälle vårt arbete når Dawit vet vi att det ger honom ytterligare styrka att kämpa vidare.

I have successfully kick started a film project before (https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/actionman/action-man-gi-joe-mission-mercury-10)

I was born in Billericay in 1965, I started following Billericay Town before the first FA Vase run in 1976. I had a blue and white knitted scarf to keep me warm. I used to also watch the players train on a Tuesday or Thursday night, and remember Peter Taylor (Spurs and England) once borrowing my ball for a few corners as they waited for the practice ball to come back from over the field. I waded up the high street in my flares to each celebratory open top bus tour through the High Street as a youngster. With obligatory blue and white silk rosette and optional home-made stripey cardboard top hat that doubled my height, I became just one of thousands of happy fans that tasted the success and notoriety that those few men brought back to Billericay. In the 1980s, my boss, Brian Cornes happened to be the Billericay Town Chairman, and I had my wedding reception in the Clubhouse in 1987. I used to hand draw the posters for the countless social events in the clubhouse at this time, made the away team metal name boards for above the turnstiles, and would sometimes work on the programme artwork with my father Ken Wisdom.

Wonderful things are happening once more at the club thanks to Glenn Tamplin an ambitious owner. It's all very, very different, but at the same time just the same - just brought up to date - visiting the humble but perfect New Lodge down the narrow Blunts Wall Road and expecting a home win, then singing until your voice finally goes and squinting into the second half sunshine and seeing a hat trick is the same as I can remember in the 1970s. It's a joy never to be forgotten.

I made all the Wembley Finals. Uncovering footage of Youngy's last goal at Wembley in getting the the project together has been the greatest pleasure after meeting my heroes of course, and them befriending me. They are truly wonderful, youthful gentlemen. Fred had hundreds of press cuttings, as did Geoff, and Youngy and JP had some films.

I will put my heart and soul into this project and my one wish for this project is a legacy of a youngster going up to one of the Vase players and asking him for an autograph. Then my job will be done.

Aged 16, I started full time and completed a modern apprenticeship in Travel and Tourism. At 18 I decided I wanted to join the Police.
I'd passed all my entrance exams and successfully got into Greater Manchester Police.
Then I found out I was pregnant (aged 18!)
My boyfriend (now husband) carried on at college and achieved so much, whilst I continued working as a Travel Agent. I was basically working to pay nursery fees. But I loved it and I have a strong work ethic, so it was worth it.
18 months later my daughter was seriously ill and spent 2 months in hospital. I gave up my job/career to stay at the hospital with her, whilst my boyfriend worked hard to pay the bills and keep a roof over our head.
Since, then I've been a secretary, receptionist, pot washer, dinner lady..... none of them with real career potential.
Fast forward a few years and we're married, my husband has an amazing career, my daughter is doing exceptionally well at high school.
Now it's time for ME!
This is my passion. This is to be my career.

Chris, being the artist / designer that he is, had the idea of starting a personal project with a couple of goals in mind. He began drawing one Bible verse each week in order to help in his own memorization of Scripture, as well as to have this art to put up around the house as daily reminders of God's Word for our family. After the first several designs were complete, Chris decided to create a place online where he could make the designs available to others as free wallpaper downloads. We didn't know if anyone would ever find them, but here we are now almost five years later with the incredible privilege of shipping Scripture art all over the world!

Our prayer was and still is to use this little family business of ours for His glory and to encourage others.:::1023:::186:::0.1365625:::0.29104166666666664:::1:::6:::2018|||"

Deduction Card Game, VERTIUM: Shadows of the Complex (SciFi), SHOOTERZ Hockey Card Game, STRIKERZ Soccer Card Game, WORDOPOLIS, and the author of Gold & Sharpe (a novella inspired by Get Adler!). I grew up in beautiful Cape Breton, Nova Scotia. Looking back on my childhood, I can remember inventing games.
At around 9 and 10 years of age, I used to sit down outside and show hockey cards to my beloved dog Spotty. I also made mini baseball games in the dirt with sticks and small pebbles. And best of all, I used to cut out those same hockey cards and play hockey at the kitchen table, with a silver ball for the puck: the foil from my mother's cigarette package.

Fast forward to the late 90's, I got an eye injury at work, which made me photophobic. I couldn't take bright lights and had to wear sunglasses all the time outside. I couldn't watch TV and I couldn't work on computers. The kids and I seemed to go back in time, and we spent many evenings reading, listening to the radio and playing games. Much to my surprise, I began to invent games again ...

I have had lots of help through the years, and I thank God for each person and each invention. I hope you will enjoy the games we bring here. Caper Games - bringing games to life! Enjoy! Randall:::1336:::250:::0.13415637860082305:::0.27132201646090537:::24:::43:::2015|||"

We want to create art with textile and express ourselves with our clothing designs. With focus on luxurious every day clothing we wan't people to stand out in crowd and feel unique. We want to make sure that every piece of clothing and every design that we do is different and limited. We want our customers to be able to treasure the fact that they own something special and something that they will wear with great pride.

We're a team of four individuals. All, with different personalities, origins and hobbies. However, there's one thing that we have in common and that is our devotion in clothes and fashion. Our goal is to create a clothing brand that will grow into one of the finest and most sought after brands in the world.

By having our products made in Italy, we can guarantee you that the quality will be exceptionally high and that our customers won’t be be disappointed when they wear the products. But this is a dream, and to make dreams true, you will need funding. Unfortunately, money is a scarce resource for students and young people. Therefore, we have decided to opt for crowdfunding. The money that we will gain from donations will go to cover the production of prototypes and samples. We will, once we have raised the money, order our prototypes thet will arrive within 4-6 weeks. We will keep all interested partys updated with information regarding the production process and show behind the scenes pictures and videos of our products being made.

In order to make our dreams become reality we are going to need your support. Please help a team of young entrepreneurs who all share a common goal, to make a mark in the fashion industry.

Then, at age 15, something clicked. I saw the Exorcist. Now I've seen hundreds of horror movies and I'm looking to direct them after I graduate college.

My first short film was In The Night, the story of a girl, who's stalked by a mysterious stranger in the night. I wrote the film in a week (It was my first screenplay), then cast, shot, edited, and released the film in only a weekend. My second short film was Find My Friend which follows a high school girl and her sister, looking for her lost lost boyfriend all the while a dangerous killer lurks in the dark. Find My Friend took 5 months to create and was the largest scale film I embarked on. It took the help of many of my colleagues to bring it to screen.

"1357924012:::219277745:::Glen Brereton Jr.:::I remember hiking with my parents on vacation. My favorite hike was when I was about 12 years old. We went to a state park in Tennessee and just started walking the trail. Then we came to a swinging bridge. Dad was carrying my youngest brother. My brother, my sister, and I crossed the bridge with Dad. Mom is afraid of bridges so she stayed behind. My sister went back across the bridge, but the rest of us kept hiking down the trail. We just enjoyed the scenery and explored it together. A while later we encountered a parking lot and Dad realized we were lost. We saw some people and he asked them where the other parking lot was. They said it was on the other side of the park. They offered us a ride back and we finally returned to the car. That is a memory I will forever cherish. Hiking will always be special to me. My mission statement at Hikerauthor is: Watch eagles soar and hear waterfalls roar. I bring the beauty of nature to you.

"202940625:::1047816554:::Josje van Oostrom:::About 30 years ago I fell in love, not with Antonio or Roberto, but with Italy itself; I was moved by its beauty that I found in the art, the buildings, the landscape and later the language, the ice cream the food and the wines. As I was studying in Florence I discovered that there were still so many wine grapes unfamiliar to me and that made me decide I wanted to get to know them all. And here I am, still looking for discoveries � Meanwhile I have worked as a tour guide, studied (partially) Italian and Renaissance Art history, followed a course to become an Italian sommelier (AIS) , travelled throughout Italy to get to know all wine regions, lived in Rome and Florence and now live here in Liguria at the coast. I want to inspire others and share my passion for this beautiful country and its treasures.

Contribution I was born on a farm. Raised with cows, pigs, sheep and space all around me, green surroundings and a whole lot of peace and quiet. Vegetables from the garden, fruits right from the trees. Pure and unsprayed, top quality produce. Slaughtering happened right at home, you knew the origin of the meat on your plate (never our own animals, my dad couldn’t take that). But later, you discover that that top quality you took for granted all these years isn’t quite so obvious anymore. Very difficult to find even. But it still exists. I think my past is why I recognize it so easily, in wines too. The pure honesty of the produce. In Italy it’s easier to find, those unadulterated flavours. That of course has something to do with the weather too. Wine growers draw on past and ancient techniques and combine them with present day’s knowledge. Simple nostalgia? No. A return to the original flavours without invasive intervention in nature and without chemical pesticides or additives. Participating in preserving our wonderful mother earth and bringing back biodiversity.
During my studies I spent long periods in Florence and I almost always went to Italy on holiday. I specialised in Italian wines with courses and master classes (for example at Gaja, Ornellaia, Pio Cesare, etc.) followed by visits to vineyards and tastings. In 2008-2009, I successfully passed the Italian sommelier training course, held by the AIS. I am one of the first Italian wine sommeliers of the Netherlands! But now living in Italy to do more research on wine-territories, to be able to guide people around and just for the sake of being surrounded always by this wonderful country with its amazing amount of art, wine etc!

In the Netherlands I have (and am still occasionally) been guiding wine-tastings, offering courses on both Italian wines & Renaissance art, and since I live here in Italy I have converted those courses into online material that you can study from everywhere. I have been writing for some blogs (naturalfoodandwine.com), a Dutch magazine on Italy (providing them with wine-food-pairings), offer advice to wine-importers which organic winery’s to choose etc.
3. Why Back to Nature?
I would love our beautiful planet, mother earth to survive. It needs people that take custody over area’s and help it thrive, like natural winegrowers do. I dream of a world without chemicals, for starters in the vineyards and the wine cellar! Natural resistance in the vineyards -and your body while giving it the nutrients it deserves. My main values are Nature, Connection with the source and authenticity. I really want that my knowledge of Italian wines and of biological, biodynamical and natural wines contributes to a more conscious choice. All/Everything is energy, if I can convey that message, even about wines, I accomplished my goal.:::4383:::732:::0.15823593073593073:::0.33698103814175245:::1:::0:::2018|||"

"685752603:::51791227:::Farookh Shaikh:::Farookh Shaikh, 55, was born in Pune and resided there for the first three decades of his life. While in Pune, he worked variously as the executive secretary of Poona Automotive Racing Association; on the sports desk of the Times of India (PunePlus); and as the associate editor of a monthly automotive magazine, Car & Bike International.
In 1995, he became the Sports Editor of ‘The Gulf Today’, an English daily in the U.A.E. He worked there for five years before he was lured over to Singapore, where his company Hit Veda Holdings is based. He worked in this South-East Asian nation for The Straits Times broadsheet and MediaCorp’s TODAY tabloid. He was then headhunted by a Japanese educational group to produce a new curriculum and to teach Japanese youths and adults. He was with this group for just under 10 years and had occasion to travel widely to the school’s headquarters in Japan and to its branches all over SEA. He then taught at another Japanese school till this month. Currently awaiting a move to Japan to work there, he has decided to devote most of his time to writing.
On the educational front, he obtained his B.Sc. as an alumnus of Nowrosjee Wadia College, Pune. He then acquired his Masters Diploma in Journalism & Mass Communication from Symbiosis Institute. Here, he received the Lokmanya Tilak gold medal for placing first in the Masters. Later, he was also awarded the Rotary Club award for Vocational Excellence in Journalism. In 2015, he acquired his Diploma in TESOL from a UK-based college, securing Grade ‘A’s in all modules and in the Practicum. He has studied and can speak six languages: English, Hindi, Marathi, French, German (conversational) and Japanese (beginner level). He is also an inventor and his one-handed keyboard was granted a patent (P-No. 154608) by The Registry of Patents, Singapore, in 2012. In this innovative keyboard layout, all alphanumeric keys and the regularly used punctuation keys can be operated by the five fingers of one hand. The idea of AdvenChaar was birthed in Spring 2005 and took 11 years to reach fruition. Simultaneously, the planning and shaping of the other adventures that our youngsters will be involved in henceforth has also been an ongoing process. The second adventure, AdvenChaar & The 16 Pure Annas (A4PA16), has already been fleshed out and 40,000 words have already been written.
He is the recipient of the Rotary Club Award for Excellence (in Journalism).:::2446:::416:::0.05994494635798984:::0.15462019864193777:::1:::0:::2017|||"

"152730994:::2104193174:::Grey Fox Games:::Long before we made games, we played them. I have personally enjoyed playing games for as long as I can remember. From board games to video games to pretty much anything that involved the word ""play"", I have always been attracted to gaming. I still remember the day I decided I hated dice rolling games (it involved an ""impossible"" loss in Castle Risk that haunts me to this day). Being a gamer and enjoying this hobby is what drove me to this business. I've always believed in doing what you love and I can't think of anything I'd rather do than work in this industry. As for why Grey Fox Games needs to run a KS. The answer to that is simple. While we have the funds to design a game (art graphics, play testing, etc), the money to actually manufacture and distribute is another story. Making a game is a very lengthy and costly process and without Kickstarter, we would simply be unable to launch many of our ventures.
My commitment is to never publish a game that I myself would not want to play (I've sort of come to terms with that Castle Risk loss after 30 years, so dice may very well show up in our titles). I truly feel that we have something to offer and we hope that after you've played our games, you'll feel the same way.

Her passion for film-making has been consistent throughout her childhood, which was reflected by creative visual projects she has been in charge of, but it was the summer of 2015 the passion and dream was really ignited, and when she took the step further to do something about it. It led to her working besides school as a volunteer on other film sets to grasp as much knowledge about film productions as possible - which have payed off. She has produced two short films while still studying on the side. The first short 'Copenhagen Central Station' was financed solely through a succesful Kickstarter-campaign and is to be found on her company Astri Production's website. Her next film 'Happily Perfect' was supported by the Copenhagen Filmworkshop with facilities and equipment, and he current project 'Alan Isaac' is also supported by the workshop with an addition of a monetary funding. As it is her far most ambitious project yet, this support is not sufficient for the required budget of the Sci-Fi short film, hence the search for additional help through another Kickstarter-campaign.:::1257:::208:::0.11802083333333334:::0.3517013888888889:::2:::20:::2016|||"

I felt I wasn't able to conceive naturally and the worry before conceiving, during treatment and throughout the pregnancy brought a lot of anxiety. All I wanted to do was the most natural thing in the world- to boob them myself with no problems, worries or intervening.

Since having my twins, who are currently and have been from the start, soley breastfed- I have noticed there is much work to be done in the breastfeeding world to support and cheerlead mothers. As well as that, I feel our norks are sexualised rather than celebrated for what they are here for. So this is why I have started The Boob Store- to celebrate boobs, to raise issues around breasts. To encourage nork chat. From breastfeeding, to breast cancer, to body image.:::1041:::188:::0.11694214876033059:::0.3788223140495868:::1:::0:::2018|||"

After a couple of years I had the opportunity to move to Bangkok, the capital of Thailand, and help my aunt who owned a vegetarian restuarant. There I was introduced to the idea of a meatless diet, and after a few years I became a vegetarian myself. Later due to health issues, I found that a vegan diet was even healthier for me, and I began only preparing and eating plant-based recipes.

After learning the restaurant business from my aunt and uncle, I decided my mission would be to start my own business. I began with a food cart on the streets of Bangkok in 1988 with just two stools for customers to sit. After saving my money for years, I was able to open my first restaurant in 1993.

Today I own restaurants and cooking schools in Bangkok and Chiang Mai Thailand, and spend most of my time teaching private classes in the USA.:::1067:::199:::0.185:::0.3919444444444445:::7:::6:::2016|||"

I'm 20 years old, with Colombian origins, but currently a Canadian citizen. Last year, I took the plane from Montreal to live my dream: travel to Australia. In Australia, I started doing interviews with coffee consumers for my project, and even visited a coffee plantation there! An amazing experience. Now, I'm a week away from my next travel: a trip to Colombia to meet actual coffee producers. So excited! Some more personal information about me: I just finished taking a gap year, so I am starting university in September. I will study business administration, and try to mix my fascination for coffee, and my desire to create a more sustainable world into something that I still can't completely explain. But I'm getting there. I absolutely love to dance, and talk to people. Not shy at all to start conversations with strangers in the streets, or dance in the subway. Always smiling, and sharing my love for life through writing. Oh, and I like to meditate. I recently found out I had a kind of spiritual hippie side to me. Thanks Byron Bay for that!

Canadian identical twin sister writing and directing duo Jen and Sylvia Soska, known as the ""Twisted Twins"", first broke onto the scene with their DIY love letter to Grindhouse filmmaking, DEAD HOOKER IN A TRUNK. The film quickly grew into an award winning, critically acclaimed, cult classic sensation, even getting the attention of director Eli Roth (HOSTEL) who praise it saying, ""it's fucking awesome"". The Twins went on to follow up their break through indie gem with the accomplished and genre defining AMERICAN MARY that place horror icon KATHARINE ISABELLE in the title role of Mary Mason, a medical student who gets drawn into the world of body modification and underground surgeries. ""Fucking amazing. Extraordinary. A really superb picture. Katharine Isabelle is awesome"", hailed horror legend Clive Barker (HELLRAISER). The Soska Sisters have gone on to be very outspoken about equal rights across the board including but not limited to the LGBTQ community. They're actively involved in promoting blood donation and create a new PSA for it every February in celebration of Women In Horror Month, on which board they serve. And they are only just getting started.

2014 was a big year with the Soska Sisters bringing a new life to SEE NO EVIL 2 where they resurrect the WWE Studios franchise with WWE Superstar Glenn ""Kane"" Jacobs reprising his role as Jacob Goodnight and scream queens Danielle Harris and Katharine Isabelle appearing together for the first time. As well, the Twins will be part of the all star director line up on ABCs of Death 2 in a segment that will both shock audiences and be destined for cult status where they reunite with AMERICAN MARY break out star Tristan Risk and numerous other familiar faces from the horror scene. Always ones to surprise their audiences and keep everyone guessing with what they'll do next, the Soska Sisters completed their first film outside of horror, a balls to the wall, no holds barred action film with Lionsgate and WWE Studios called VENDETTA starring Dean Cain, Paul ""The Big Show"" Wight, and Michael Eklund like you've never seen them before. ""The Soska Twins break half the established rules of screenwriting and somehow get away with it, and their direction is clever and assured throughout. More importantly, they show a sense of cultural awareness that most of their white male peers don't even seem to know exists. This allows them to step into dangerous territory with a maturity, insight, and humanity that rarely seen in this genre anymore."" Dan Schaffer (DOGWITCH)""

"1575811103:::186513426:::Symbolic Square:::“Pursue your dreams!” were my friend’s last farewell words before her passing. Her phrase caught me by surprise. The job and responsibilities to my family did not leave me much room for dreams. My “wisdom” was in stern contradiction to her advice.

During the next couple of years, my friend’s words were ringing in my ears. Advertisement slogans like “You can do it!”, “If you never try, you’ll never know!” and “Yes, you can!” would constantly bombard me from my car radio and bus posters. I learned to ignore these thoughts and continued the monotony of my 9 am to 5 pm job counting the everlasting days to retirement. The seed, however, had been planted and was now growing into a serious passion. Finally, the day came that I decided to shut the door on my complacency and jump into my uncertain future to pursue my dream. I have established the Symbolic Square company to produce high-end luxury scarves, a classy and timeless addition to any wardrobe.

Tireless seeking for the meaningful intriguing design, perfect composition and colors launched the creation of this blue scarf.

Please support our talented team in bringing the idea of the Symbolic Square scarves into a reality.

My name is Seth, im 25 and i was baptized when i was 8 years old. I served a mission for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints in Mozambique, Africa from 2012 - 2014. In all honesty, returning home wasn't exactly the easiest transitions. I went through some trialling experiences, but had a lot of growth, I wish I recorded it to look back on. I was at work a few weeks ago and had the impression to pray and fast about how i could help members worldwide strengthen and maintain their faith....and these Journals were the answer i recieved!

Hi, I'm Sarah (Sezzy). I've been married to my smok'n hot husband (Seths older brother) for 14 years now and we have 4 stunner kids to show for it! So my story in the church started when I was baptised at 18. It has changed my life in so many ways. Throughout my time in the church I have often heard the counsel to keep a Journal but didn't quite grasp the gravity of it until I lost my Dad recently. I wish I had a record of his life, experiences, his memories and thoughts. I've made it my personal mission to leave behind a 'Book of Sarah' for my kids and I want to help others do the same.

"612193603:::1565608060:::Dzondi (Mirza Hamzic):::I was born in Tuzla, Bosnia, November 16, 1992. This was at the start of the Bosnian War that started in the early months of 1992. As a baby, my parents and I, were driven out of our home from the opposing army and we became refugees living in bombed out shelters until I was 8 years old.After celebrating my first birthday at the age of 8 we got papers and were transported to Phoenix Arizona, USA on a refugee program. I finished 1st grade in Bosnia in a town called Celic. I started 2nd grade in America and after finishing 8th grade i moved back to Bosnia in 2007. During my early childhood years in America i was bullied and picked on because i was different from all the other kids and I never really fit into anywhere. I started listening to rap and primarily started off with Eminem because i was a skinny white kid and i connected with Slims rhymes. It made me get out of my ball and stand up for myself. After moving back to Bosnia i finished 3 years of High School there and it was a very hard first couple of years because i didn't really fit in there as well because by then i was more of used to American culture. I fell into a bad crowd of friends and i got kicked out of my 4th year of High School because of bad grades and spending class time drinking at a bar across the street. I started writing raps in Bosnian and around the age of 16, when not working on my parents farm would do small shows where i would rap a couple of songs to a good ovation. After getting into more trouble with cops and after drinking more than usual at that age my dad moved us back to Phoenix, Arizona. I got my first job in the USA at Walmart and after 6 months i went to work at a Hotel in Scottsdale Arizona as a banquet setup house-person. Moving tables and chairs all day. I continued writing raps but started going through huge depression cycles where i would drink a lot and get into fights. I was missing my friends from back home and after 6 years of Bosnia i was more accustomed to it and yet again felt like an outsider back in the states. After making a small bedroom studio i continued to write raps and record songs in Bosnian and later primarily in English.:::2169:::422:::0.07000350140056023:::0.26909547152194213:::1:::0:::2018|||"

"1361800009:::1074459473:::notamuse:::Driven by the lack of female role models in graphic design, »notamuse« is a project that critically investigates the visibility of women graphic designers in the design public. While there are many women working in the field, the public discourse as we encounter it on conferences and blogs, in design books and design history is still dominated by men. With notamuse we try to find reasons by interviewing women designers, design historians and sociologists. More than than we keep our eyes open for outstanding contemporary women graphic designers. As a result we created the book notamuse – A New Perspective on Women Graphic Designers in Europe that showcases the work of more that 50 women designers, such as Isabel Seiffert (Offshore Studio), Tereza Ruler (The Rodina), Caterina Bianchini and many more. To make the public perception of design and the discourse within design a little bit more diverse, we find it necessary to focus on the great women graphic designers who are out there – to give them a stage, role models to young designers and inspirational work and attitudes to all of us.:::1099:::186:::0.16168718434343435:::0.36519570707070703:::1:::0:::2018|||"

Mark also started to paint aircraft on canvas at the age of 17 as a hobby. A lifelong interest in flying and aviation history together with his professional knowledge of light as a photographer, soon combined to produce work of the highest standards in this exacting field. In 1987, he became the first ever Artist in Residence at the Royal Air Force Museum, Hendon, returning again in 2012 to reprise the role for the 25th Anniversary.

At the age of 27, Mark was elected to become the youngest Full Member of the Guild of Aviation Artists and shortly after, left photography to make a full time profession in aviation art.

During his subsequent 25 year career, Mark has flown in a variety of front line military aircraft as well as historic types such as the FE2b and the Fieseler Storch.

Mark is now firmly established as one of the world’s leading aviation artists with many of his limited editions now only available on the secondary market and his larger originals now regularly selling for over £10,000. His work also appears on over 150 book covers for Osprey Publishing.

15 years ago, Mark also co-founded Red Kite, an historic aviation book publisher with now over 50 books published. His extensive experience in print, design and aviation history ensures that Red Kite’s books are not only visually stunning but also have the depth of knowledge to satisfy the most demanding of readers.

Mark now spends his time between his two houses in Poland and England along with his Polish wife Asia and two ‘mudblood’ children Kasia and Szymek.:::1794:::308:::0.09615800865800864:::0.2368409368409368:::1:::0:::2018|||"

"783703523:::1870235091:::Shane Wheatcroft:::I’ve been making art in some form or another since I was a kid. So far, I’ve mainly worked in painting and screen printing, but in the last couple of years, I’ve concentrated more on mixed media and collage. My ideas tend to be led by the images I find, so I’ll start with an image I’m drawn to and randomly add pieces until an idea starts to emerge, adding more collage pieces, paint, found objects etc. to reinforce the final concept. Often, the initial image won’t feature in the final piece, but it ’s been invaluable as a starting point.
I’ve always loved books and collecting, so collage has given me a great excuse to spend loads of time hunting through second hand bookshops, charity shops, and antique markets for material. I’ve always admired artists who use collage in their work such as Peter Blake, Hannah Hoch and Jamie Reid, but it was discovering the work of John Stezaker which really opened my eyes to the possibilities of collage and how even just a couple of cleverly juxtaposed photographs can create a powerful new image.:::1044:::203:::0.09663419913419914:::0.47060606060606064:::1:::2:::2016|||"

Desde mi embarazo había una cosa que tenía muy clara: quería lactar a mi bebé, pues me había documentado acerca del tema y sabía que es lo mejor que podía ofrecerle al recién nacido. Pero llegado el momento eran tantas las dudas y tantas las opiniones y la información contrapuesta que recibía, que amamantar se convirtió en todo un reto. Tras muchas consultas, lecturas, intentos y práctica, logré establecer la lactancia de manera exitosa, mantenerla y disfrutarla junto con mi pequeña.

Con mi segundo hijo fue todo más sencillo: ya había un aprendizaje y experiencia previos; muchas dudas estaban resueltas, pero aun así seguía descubriendo cosas nuevas cada día.

Sin esperarlo me había convertido en referente para familiares y amigas que llegaban a la maternidad y que le pedían consejos para lograr una lactancia exitosa (incluso nutricionistas y especialistas en medicina). Así que he decidido plasmar en un libro mi experiencia, para

Based on many experiences since on various trainingweekends, weeks, granfondos, cycling within a club and having become a trainer I started to explore 'what is good cyclist nutrition?'. In my daily job I am developing AI-based prediction tools to forecast what marketing spends will bring companies in additional sales. Over a year ago during the Maratona Dles Dolomites I started thinking could cycling nutrition be predicted with data? Before big events such as GranFondo and during training trips I always find fellow riders and myself getting stressed on solid foodplans and making sure not to hit the wall during cycling. Since then I have tried to bring my profession and passion together to solve this problem. This has lead so far to an algorithm that predicts how intense certain bike rides will be for specific riders. Together with an exercise physiologist we found a way to match this scientifically proven against nutrition needs. Next year I hope we can all use the EatMyRide app and feel even more energized on the bike:::1111:::186:::0.10039682539682539:::0.20607363315696647:::1:::1:::2018|||"

"340463390:::572050847:::REEFA:::REEFA is a feature film based on the true story of Israel “Reefa” Hernandez, an 18-year-old art prodigy. Israel and his family moved to Miami, Florida from Barranquilla, Colombia on an asylum visa to escape the intensifying threats they were facing back home. They left everything they had behind for the promise of safety and opportunity for Israel and his sister Offir in America. Israel’s artistic talent was obvious from a young age, but it was only during his time at Miami Beach Senior High School that it solidified, earning him dozens of national accolades and an art scholarship. His name began popping up all over Wynwood, the increasingly popular “Mecca” for street artists and graffiti writers. Established artists were looking for the young “Reefa” with the beautiful flowers and distinct petals.

After graduating in 2013, Israel was looking forward to his last summer in Miami with his family and friends. While painting, skateboarding, and enjoying being a kid before moving to New York City, he meets Frankie, an up-and-coming model in town for a few weeks. Israel and Frankie soon form an instant bond, and their improbable friendship soon becomes a passionate love story.

On August 6, 2013, as Frankie awaits his evening call in NYC and his parents sleep soundly at home, Israel decides to spray paint his last wall, a wall the world could see. It would command immediate respect from his peers. There, Miami Beach police officers chase him, beat him, and eventually kill him by shooting him with a taser using severe force. Israel’s death sparked outrage in the Miami community and prompted rallies demanding justice, answers, and police reform. The United Nations Committee against torture is currently examining the case of Israel Hernandez.:::1768:::299:::0.12719913419913417:::0.3532193362193362:::1:::0:::2018|||"

"1421716661:::498374086:::Thornwillow:::In 1985 Thornwillow Press was founded by Luke Ives Pontifell who spent his summer vacations from Harvard College printing and hand-binding books. What started as a labor of love has grown into one of the leading purveyors of fine books and custom stationery in the world, consolidating centuries of craft and technique in a complex of historic buildings in Newburgh, New York.

In subscribing to a Thornwillow publication, you not only add a beautiful and important volume to your library… you support the 20 designers, printers, and binders who have dedicated themselves to these arts.

Since its founding, the Press has published over 80 editions. We have been proud to publish original work by some of the world’s leading writers, poets, artists, political leaders, scholars, historians, and journalists — from William L. Shirer to Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr., from Walter Cronkite to Chief Justice Warren Burger, from James Merrill to Mark Strand, from Helmut Kohl to Barack Obama, from John Updike to Henry Louis Gates, Jr.

In 2015, the Thornwillow Institute was founded to promote and perpetuate the art of craftsmanship in all its forms, especially related to the written word. We believe that how we communicate and preserve ideas matters. Objects you can touch, keep, and give are central to the identity of our culture. These objects become the legacy of our society. They memorialize our values, triumphs, challenges, and dreams. The Thornwillow Institute is dedicated to passing down the arts and crafts of the written word which, increasingly, are endangered. We do this through partnerships with institutions and fellowships with individual artists, students, and makers.

The Thornwillow Makers Village in Newburgh, New York, is our campus. It is a complex of historic buildings with the press at its center and around which we are developing work studios, affordable housing, a gallery and event space, a market place, class rooms, a recording and video studio, and a community bookstore and cafe.

The Village supports programming from fellowships, internships, residencies, workshops, and jobs training to publications, concerts, performances, lectures, screenings and exhibitions. The Makers Village is a place to host programming and events that bring craft and culture to the community and is a platform from which to launch what gets created here to the world at large.

"815854408:::787672616:::Sarah Sparks:::Sarah Sparks grew up as the last of five children to a pastor and his wife in rural Indiana. Sarah developed a love for singing at a young age through time with her family singing hymns on long road trips. Sarah’s freshman year of college she finally figured out how to restring a hand-me-down guitar and began learning how to play through youtube videos. Almost immediately, before she had any business doing so, she found herself writing songs. They weren’t good songs, (they only had four chords and were quite cheesy), but kind friends and family saw potential and encouraged her to keep going. She started performing at the college coffee shop with her twin sister and at other local coffee shops and restaurants.

After graduating college, Sarah found the courage to call herself a songwriter (under her breath) and began pursuing music. She moved to Louisville, KY to continue performing and a year after, funded her first album through kickstarter and released “Into the Lantern Waste,” a collection of songs inspired by the characters in The Chronicles of Narnia. The response was more than Sarah could have hoped for (aka funded!) and her desire to write songs and share them with others continued to grow. Though Sarah still has times where she is overwhelmed or anxious because she doesn’t know what she’s doing, God has been abundantly gracious in providing her every need over and over again. She couldn’t stop writing and singing if she tried. This album “All I Have” is a collection of songs from the past three years that she hasn’t been able to release since her computer broke. They are quite literally all she has but are also the work of long hours spent writing with the guitar. Sarah continues to write with truth in melody to capture human experiences through song. She thinks there is hardly anything more uncomfortable than talking about one’s self in third person, except maybe asking for money.:::1924:::346:::0.06638020833333333:::0.34283854166666666:::2:::8:::2014|||"

"2030809017:::462494028:::Ava D.:::My name is Ava and I love animals! I’m 11 years old and just started 6th grade. My favorite color is pink and my favorite food is pizza. I have 5 pets: an 11-year-old male orange tabby named Pumpkin, a chubby-wubby hamster named Timmy, my Lacy, a 2 year old miniature pinscher and 2 hermit crabs. I love my pets so much!


What inspired you to start making treats? Have you learned a lot about pet food?

Ava: I really love animals and I think they should eat just as well as we do. [My family and I] try to eat all organic foods and our pets should too! I’ve thought about Ava’s Pet Palace for a couple of years now. It’s going to be a grand place! There will be a vet, hotel, store, daycare, restaurant, shelter, and a play area all in one. We thought starting with pet treats would be a great way to learn the business. I’ve learned that a lot of pets have allergies to wheat, corn or soy. I’ve learned that a lot of people would like to feed their pet an organic and non-GMO diet as well. I’m always excited to meet people that believe their pets deserve good food. You want to be a veterinarian when you grow up – what do you like about helping animals?

Ava: This is hard for me to answer because I don’t really know what I like about it specifically. I just really like making sure animals are happy and feel good. I like to do whatever I can to make that happen! My mom says that I’ve loved animals since I was a baby. What’s your favorite treat to make? Which one is the dogs’ favorite?

Ava: My favorite treats to make are Ava’s Cheeze Pleeze Bites. The dogs’ favorite Ava’s Cheeze Pleeze Bites, because what dog doesn’t like cheese?!:::1653:::343:::0.25833333333333336:::0.4099893162393162:::2:::3:::2015|||"

"1763021694:::1943391516:::Attic Card Company:::I began collecting cards as a young boy in the late '80s. I remember the first set I ever completed by opening packs...1987 Topps Baseball. That woodgrain print is embedded in my mind. I still collect cards to this day, but have gravitated towards non-sports. There is something special about non-sports cards in that they are always relevant. Mark Hamill will never be traded to another team and will forever be Luke Skywalker. Ron Perlman will not pull his hamstring and miss the next 4-6 ""games"" of Hellboy. I developed the itch to produce my own set in 2014, but always had a reason not to pursue it. Since then I've spent time talking to many of the small presses who continue to put out innovative and fun non sports sets. With their support and generous knowledge sharing I've decided to take the plunge.

In late 2015, we converted our attic into heated/cooled livable square footage. Most of the space is reserved for my home office, but the thought of running a small card company was certainly in the blueprints and it's time to start!:::1048:::189:::0.07843253968253967:::0.3124603174603175:::11:::50:::2013|||"

My comic collection started to grow by the week as long as I behaved in Church. My love of drawing and story telling started early on in life.

I have been a published writer/comic artist ever since Jr High School. I have been published in many newspapers & magazines over the last 50 or so years and created the One Shot Press line of comics.

Our comics and One Shot Press poster and T-shirts were used in Kevin Smith's film ""Chasing Amy"" where you will also spot our ""Midnite"" look alike winner and myself in the opening comic book convention scenes of the film. Also look for my son Smokey in full ""Captain Jolly"" make up and costume in those scenes. Another of our titles ""The Philistine"" was featured in the end scenes as the comic convention shots at the end of the film were all filmed in the same weekend in New Jersey, the home of View Askew films.

One Shot Press published from 1991 through the beginning of 2003 and the comics were well reviewed. An illness that almost took my life and other issues caused One Shot Press to cease publication at that time. 2014 One Shot Press resumed publishing with the presentation of ""The Captain's Crypt of Horror"" an 80 page Trade Paper Back.

Midnite's Revenge : Book of the Dead #4 is the forth in One Shot's new format! I am looking forward to your support on this project.

I have decided that life is too short, and to make the most of every day.

"41864132:::468506875:::Allen Young:::A little about myself. I promise I'll try not to bore you

My name is Teryn Driver. I'm a guy with a vision. Working in the corporate environment (I'm a certified Anti-Money Laundering Investigator and other areas of Fraud/Risk), I found myself in the vicious cycle of purchasing, wearing, washing and getting rid of shirts WAY too soon. And all because the collar and cuffs were too worn out.

This business started off as a personal journey to find a better way to get the most out of my clothes. As I delved deeper down the rabbit hole in search of a solution, I began to realize “I’m not the only guy with this problem”. The light bulb turned on. I learned the intricacies of shirt making. I learned what it takes to make a quality and long lasting product. I cashed in all my savings, 401(k) and IRA, and have self-funded this project myself and I have no regrets. (sidebar: I could have paid my way through Princeton at this point) but I love what I do.

Now, over 2 years later, it's an awesome feeling seeing people's faces when they first see my shirts in action. It’s even better getting correspondence from long time clients who request custom shirts and suits for their wedding. I'm a consumer myself so I approach things from a ""how would I like to be treated"" approach. I don't treat people like policy. I treat people with respect. That's something you can always expect from Allen Young. I’m dedicated to the people who give Allen Young an opportunity to be a part of their wardrobe. My client’s experiences and satisfaction is a top priority for me. Hope to work with you soon!:::1600:::308:::0.08955026455026456:::0.27830687830687834:::1:::1:::2018|||"

Before graduating from Purdue University Film School, I was fortunate enough to produce and edit a documentary for GoPro's which was filmed in South Africa. It was then that I fully recognized the empowering and fulfilling feeling of visual storytelling. Immediately following the documentary release and my graduation, I moved to LA. I began networking with friends and industry professionals and with the first two weeks, I was assisting actors and directors.

You can check a part of my experience on my LinkedIn profile here (https://www.linkedin.com/in/mehdibenhassine/), don't hesitate to connect :)

So now, I have a question for you, yes you behind your screen, your phone... Do you want to change the world of Coffee with us? Do you want to be a part of this story that could be turned one day into history?
For sure, we will never forget the very first people that believed us!

"673812829:::769903919:::Marcus Sturewall:::Ända sedan jag var liten så har jag älskat att hitta på historier.
Och att göra film. Alltid med en ton av humor.
När mitt liv valde att jag skulle bli musiker och kompositör så märkte jag att det passade ändå väldigt bra att fortsätta skapa historier. Fast nu med hjälp av musiken.

Jag studerade till jazzpianist på musikerutbildningen på Kungliga musikhögskolan i Stockholm 2010.
Även om det var en inriktad genre som utbildningen rörde, så har jag alltid älskat att spela ALLT.
Magin i musiken handlar väldigt sällan om vad man egentligen spelar, utan hur det spelas och det musikaliska mötet i ett band! Det är iallafall min filosofi.

I mitt eget skapande så har jag nu fått ett brinnande intresse av musikalformen. Att hitta på en berättelse och sätta den i toner.
Känslan av att man kan hitta på vad som helst och att vad som helst kan hända, den är riktigt häftig!
Att få baka in en orkester, ett gäng sångare och dansare på detta gör inte känslan sämre..:::974:::172:::0.015384615384615385:::0.04615384615384615:::1:::0:::2018|||"
