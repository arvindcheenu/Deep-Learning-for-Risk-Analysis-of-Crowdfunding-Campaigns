# Deep Learning for Risk Analysis of Crowdfunding Campaigns

### The Objective

A project that extrapolates **three** key factors: **Enticement**, **Experience** and **Engagement** from hidden metrics by analysing Kickstarter projects to further explore the effectiveness of content and its sentiments, rewards and their **tangibility**, **funder belief** and **founder-funder engagement** in its success through analysis of textual and numeric features. To validate the discovered metrics, an **Ensemble Deep-Learning model** is proposed to predict campaigns with the greatest potential to achieve funding.
